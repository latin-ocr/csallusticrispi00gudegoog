Ch. v, ar-xiii: Dronussrou concernunt} riui ruse auu oaowrrr or
Rons arvo rins causus or 1rs naum anennuaarrorv nv nonnus.

21. Res ipsa, etc: As Sallust had previously repeatedly touched
upon the corrupted state 01 Rome, the excuse here given ior the
introduction of a long account on the same topic is unconvincing,
not to mention that it is incompatible with the statement in ch. 4, 12,
but the temptation to moralize was too strong ior him to resist. As
to the truth oi the picture, see Introd. p. xii-de moribus: this is by
lar the more common construction with admonere. The genitive, which
also occurs, would here have been awkward and in any other position
ambiguous.

aa. repetere . . . disserere: the infinit, instead oi ut (so ch. 27,
8) aiter hortari and like verbs, is rare in prose (ἓ 77).—paucis sc. verbis τ
ablat. 01 means-institute: object 01 disserere.

23· domi militiaeque: locative case.

24. habuerint. . . reliquerint . . . iacta sit: subjunct. 01 in·
direct question with disserere (ἓ 76). Ι

25. pulcherrima . . . flagitiosissima: the pairs 01 epithets are
grouped in chiastic order (a:b::b:a).

Vl
(1.) Ch. vi ε The foundation of Rome and the period of the kings.

1. Urbem: by turning the sentence into the passive we may pre·
serve the emphatic word orden—ego: here the emphasis imparted by
the insertion 01 the pronoun is particularly apparent, lor the version 101-
lowed by Sallust differs essentially from all other extant traditions con-
ceming the foundation ol Rome, varied as these are. The more gen-
erally accepted legend represented Rome as a colony 01 Alba Longa,
which had in turn been built by colonists from Lavinium, the city found·
ed by Aeneas more than four hundred years before Rome. ⁸

3. sedibus: with abodes, ablatos attendant circumstance (5 36).-
Aborigiues: this was probably an ancient Italic tribe, but as the
name was erroneously derived lrom ab and origo, it was invested with all
the ideal qualities which the ancients habitually attributed to the primi·
tive races 01 the Golden Age. See note ch. 2, 3.

4. sine legibus: Sallust is very lond 01 combining two groups, one
with apreposition, the o'ther without one. Here we have also chiasmus
(ab: b÷a), liberum corresponding to sine imperio, solutum rosim
legibus. Note also that a noun with sine serves as asubstitute for a
missing negative adjective—ln a community, where all are virtuous.
