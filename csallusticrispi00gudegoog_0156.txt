102 NOTES

5. quibus: ii, quibua-bonis . . . malistas in Greek, these

terius are frequently used as party designations. The former comprise
the higher, property-owning classes, the· optimates, aristocrats (rule oi
the best), the latter represent the democratic, non-conservative elemeut,
the party ol innovation and reiorms.

7. student: here regularly construed with the acc. with iul. See
note ch. 1, 1.

9. habetur serves as the passive of pati.—sine damno: on the
ground that having nothing to lose at the outset, they could only better
their condition-urbana plebes: urbanus populus, the people ol the
city in general as distinguished from the mob (cuncta plebes), lor oi the
malcontents mentioned below not all belonged to the lower classes,
many impoverished nobles being among them. For this meaning'ol the
word, see note ch. 31, 25.—ea vero: this addition ol the prououn tor
the salre ol emphasis is characteristic ol Sallust. Cp. ch. 20, 15. Tr.
Now as for the city population, it of course, etc.

10. praeceps, literally headlong, expresses the impatient desire ior
a change at all nazarus-de multis causis: causat deis almost wholly
confined to clauses ol this kind. So again ch. 47, 2, qua dc causa.—
Five or, counting the subdivisions separately, eight classes that lavored
Catiline's designs are enumerated. 1. Primum, ete: (a) omnium (b)
alii (c)postrem0 omnis. 2. Deinde, etc.: (a) multi (b) alios. 3. Prae·
terea. 4. Praeterea. 5. Ad hoc. This classification does not corre-
spond very closely with the six groups given by Cicero in his second
Catilinian speech, though it exhibits numerous coincidences in details.

11. probro . . . petulantie: ablat. oi respect or specification
with verbs indicating superiority (ἓ 39).

12. patrimoniis arnissis: ablat. oi quality, ior the salre of variety,
in place ol alii qui patrimonia amiserant.

13. flagitium aut facinus: in this iavorite combinatiou ol Sallust,
the second word is only here distinguished as the wealrer in meaning.-
domo: ablat. of separation (ἓ 30).

14. in sentinam: just as a sewer gathers the refuse lrom all quar-
ters‚ so Rome is represented as collecting the scum oi mankind. In the
application ol this homely but expressive metaphor Sallust had been an-
ticipated by Cicero.

16. senatores . . . divites», predicates, with factos esse understood,
as shown by ita, instead ol tam.

17. victu. . . cultu: the former relers more particularly to the
physical luxuries enjoyed by the rich, the latter to their indulgence in
dwelling-houses, in dress and other extravagant enjoyments.—agerent:
subjunct. ol result (ἓ 66).
