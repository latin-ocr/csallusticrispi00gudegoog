56 ’ NOTES

η. enimi virtust animi seems not merely superfluous (cp. note ch.
1, 14) but out of place, as virtus here includes both intellectual and
moral excellence- valeret . . . baberent: contrary-to-fact condit.
clause of which the apodosis is cerneres.

12. aequabilius. . . baberent: on the word order, cp. note ch.
1,14.

14. artibus: ablat. of means (S 33).

16. pro labore, etc. : observe the careful antithesis of the various
traits, diligence being opposed to indolence, seli-control to licentious·
ness, a sense of justice to arrogance, which implies a disregard of the
rights ol others.

18. optumum quemque: optumos is a very common Latin idiom.
The phrase is here not used in an ethical sense, but rather conveys the
idea of the most successful, as we say, ‘he who comes out best'

2ο. Quae: accusat. of the result produced (ἓ 8).-arant, etc: ,.
to be translated by nouns, accomplc'sh by, etc—virtuti: dative with
pareo (ᾗ 16).

21. omnia: sc. ea, the unexpressed antecedent of quae.

22. indocti incultique: on the alliterative combination of virtually
synonymous terms, see note ch.1, 11.—peregrinantes: as if they were
merely transient visitorS, life being by a familiar metaphor conceived as
a pilgrimage or a country to be traversed.

23. transegere, a so-called gnomic perfect which, as it expresses a
general truth‚ has the force of a present. The verb is here used for
transire, Sallust having a special fondness for ago and its compounds
-quibus . . . voluptati oneri: double dative with esse, the first being
a dat. of reference, the others of purpose (ἓ 17).

27. aliquo negotio intentus: the ablat. with intentus for the
dative, or the accus with in or ad seems to be an innovation of Sallust.
It is either instrumental (busy with) or causal (occupied by reason of).
To retain the metaphor, derived from the bendiugof a bow, we may
translate ι bent upon some enterprise.

28. praeclari . . . bonae: note the chiasmus (a : b : ε b ε a).

1. rei publicae: dat. of indirect object (ξ 16).

2. bene dicere: as the literary works of the ancients were primarily
intended to be read aloud, dicere is habitually used as a synonym of scribere.
The context also shows that bene dicere cannot refer to oratorical excel-
lence here, for that would not be a contrast to benefacere, as the states-
man and the orator in antiquity were generally combined in one man.
