lust puts a strong objection to it into the mouth of Cato (ch. 52, 51 n).

Observe also that Caesar not only advocates 1 penalty hitherto unknown
to the Roman law, but himself deprives the conspirators of the very
trial which he had so strenuously insisted upon as prerequisite. lt was
probably this glaring inconsistency that gave rise to the version, re·
corded in later writers, that he had suggested only temporary con·
finement and that a regular trial was to take place so soon as Catiline
had been disposed of.

139. valent: the indicative in oratio obliqua, as so often in Sallust.
Cp. note ch. 14, 13.

140. referat . . . agat: these are the technical terrns for sub-
mitting a matter to the decision of the senate or the people. This pro-
viso shows that the proposal was unconstitutional. for all legal enact·
ments were as such final.

141. fecerit. . ‚facturum :fecerit (fut. perf), senatus eum . . .

facere (or secisse) exestumabe't or a senatu . . . fecisse existumabitur ln
direct discourse.

1. verbo . . . adsentiebantur: the technical phrase for acquies-

silently by going 1ο one or the other side in a division (pedibus ire r'n
sententiam) or else he could make 1 set speech.

2. alii: dative. There were at least three motions before the house.
that of Silanus, of Caesar and of Tiberius Nem. varie showing that
Sallust here includes all the speakers up to Cato, who was one of the
very last to take the floor before the final vote, and who succeeded in
’ turning the tide. Cicero spoke shortly after Caesar (Fourth Speech
against Catiline), but before Nero, and hence he knew of but two mo·
tions. As presiding officer he summed up the debate‚ but he does so
with a decided preference for the original resolution.

(4.) Ch. lii, 5 ft: The speech os Cato the Yeunger.

That the speech is the rhetorical production of Sallust is again evi·
dent from its style, but that it deviated more widely than that of Caesar
from what was actually spoken is clear from the following considera-
tions: (1) The manner of address and the sentiments expressed while
not false to the well-known character of Cato, seem out of place at

this early stage of his career. (2) We have the authority of Cicero and
