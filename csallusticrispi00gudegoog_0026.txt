style, strict chronological sequence and a bald recital of
mere facts may well have seemed to him subsidiary to his
main design.

The trustworthiness 'oi any historical narrative de·
pends upon the disposition oi the writer to tell the truth,
as he sees it, and upon the authenticity of the sources ol
information at his disposal. In the case ol the conspir-
acy οἱ Catiline, Sallust could avail himself oi personal
observation, contemporaneous gossip¹ and rumors, which
in times of excitement are sure to arise in prolusion, and

Cicero's speeches, the M emoir of his consulship, written
in Greek, his poem de consulum, and his prose account,
entitled de consiliis meis. Besides these, letterS, pamphlets,
published reminiscences and speeches could also be con·

can no longer, in view oi the loss of most of his authori-
ties, be accurately determined, for he mentions only
’ Cicero's first speech against Catiline and a statement oi
Crassus, made to him personally; but the lact that he
quotes two letters in the original shows clearly that he
spared no pains to secure authentic information. Ii we
nevertheless discover irreconcilable contradictions with
still extant writers, contemporary and post-Sallustian, and
, not a lew omissions and divergences in details, the lact is
in a large measure due to the originally conflicting char·
acter ol the testimony itseli. Moreover, when Sallust
began to write, all the principal actors who figured in
the Conspiracy had passed away, many items had become
obscure, distorted, or had been lorgotten. To this it must
be added that the dramatic or rhetorical exigencieS, irorn
' which Sallust could not emancipate himself il he hoped
ior readers, are also responsible ior some oi the discrep-

ancies which to a certain extent blur the picture. But'

we are generally in a position to clear away these accre-
