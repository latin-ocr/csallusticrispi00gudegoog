54 NOTES

⁶. altemm . . . alterum refer respectivelyto animi imperio and
corporis servitio, not, as the neuter might suggest, to imperio and servi-
tio alone-nobis: with pronouns conmunis regularly takes the dative,
with nouns the genitive is equally frequent.

8. ingeni . . . virium correspond to animi and emporia-opibus:
ablat. of means (§ 33).-quaerere . . . efficere: the infinitives are
the subject of videtur (sc. esse), esse being in such cases generally omit·
ted as in English. ·

9. qua: ablat. with fruimur (ξ 33).

10. nostri, our. objectiva genitive—maxume longam: for lon-
gissimam to mark a more emphatic contrast with brevis.

11. divitiarum et formae are made especially emphatic by po.
sition-fluxa atque fragilis: the Latin is exceedingly fond of such
apparently tautological combinations, alliterative groups being especially
common. So in Engl. house and kome,safeand round. Here because
of the antithesis ( gloria-virtus), the second member also has two attrib-
utives. This rhetorical device is known as libration or ‘balancing’
A careful attention to such minutiae will prove very helpful in giving a
proper insight into the niceties of an artistic Latin style.

12. habetur is a favorite word with Sallust, being used in many
idiomatic combinations See Vocabulary.

13. mortales as a noun is originallya poetic substitute for homines.

It is much affected by Sallust and by his frequent imitator, the historian
Tacitus (1st cent. Α. ta), Cicero using it only with an adj. like multi,
omnes.
Α 14. vine . . . virtute: abl. of means (ς 33).-·ne . . . an: this
is the regular form of the double question in Sallust, utrum . . . an
being found in but two passages—animi, though often superfluously
added to abstract nouns, is here used to balance with corporis. On the
meaning of virtus, see Vocab-res militaris, being cited only by way
of illustration, is made to follow all the more emphatic terms, thus at-
tracting less attention than il it had been placed in close proximity to
certamen. Note, however, that the juxtaposition of subject and predi·
cate at the end is a favorite collocation of Sallust. Cp. e. g. ch. 2, 8.
21; 5, 22; 58, 16.

15. procederet: subjunctos indit. question, following the sequence
of tenses (ᾖ 76), whereas in English general truths stand in thepresent.
—incipias . . . consulueris: subjunctos indef. ad pers. sing. (ἓ 48).
-consttlto . . . facto: ablat. of means with opus est. The perf.
pass. partic. are equivalent to abstract nouns, a colloquial usage com·
mon in early Latin. That the verbal origin was still lelt is shown by the
adverbial modifier (mature).
