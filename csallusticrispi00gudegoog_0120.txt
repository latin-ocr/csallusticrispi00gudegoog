66 NOTES

except the poets Naevius and Ennius, his numerous historical predeces-
sorS, though able men were among them, either wrote in an inartistic
Latin style or in Greek. This would be a sufficient reason ior Sallust,
as it certainly was ior Cicero, to ignore their existence. See note ch.
3, 7, and Introd. p. xiv ff. That the reference is not to the period be·
lore the Punic Wars is shown by numquam.

1. Igitur is often used to mark the resumption oi a narrative aiter a
digression. The entire chapter presents a roseate, idealized picture oi
conditions completely at variance with the real facts. It is: however,
intended to serve as an emphatic contrast to the gradual demoralization ’
oi Rome which actually did lollow the subjugation ol Carthage and
Greece.

2. concordia . . . avaritia: observe the chiasmus and adversative
asyndeton, sed being omitted. So again l. 7, audacio . . . aequitate.

3. legibus . . . natura: abl. of cause (ἓ 34).

4. valebat: on the sing. aiter two abstract subjectS, though the two

11. contra imperium, eto: a good 'illustratiou is given in ch. 52,
not.

12. tardius belongs to excesserant—proelio . . . loco: abl. ol
separation (ἓ 30).

15. accepta iniuria: abl. absol, here equivalent to a temporal
clause. We expect these words to depend upon ignoscere, persequi,
but the acc. or dat. was impossible, because these verbs do not govern
the same case.

(3.) Ch. x-xiii: The moral ond political deterioration of Rome as a
consequence os success and world empire.

This description, though also rhetorically colored and overdrawn,
contains many elements of truth.—Notice also the effective asyndeton
throughout these chapters

Perseus oi Macedon were conquered between 274 and 167 u. 0.-ἁο-
