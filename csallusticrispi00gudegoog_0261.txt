TWENTIETH OEthJRY TExT-ssooKs

Eight Orations os Cicer0, together with
Selected Passages and Letters

Edited, with an Introduction, Notes‚ anda Vocab-
ulary, by CHARLEs H. Fouens, A.M., Professor of
Latin in Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass. 12mo.

Cloth, 8140.

The text of the first six orations in this book is that oi
C. F. W. Miiller, now commonly used in the best school·
books abroad. For the Pro Milone and the Pro Marcello
the superior readings ol A. C. Clark, in the Oxford series,
have been adopted. The Senecam) PASSAGES for extra
reading were chosen for their worth and beauty, and these,
together with the few short Lucanus, will afford a glimpse
of the orator in other fields oi literature. But the student's
strength should be given to the understanding oi Cicero as
an orator—a task quite difficult enough for a year's study.
The Norus are designed for studente and have been tested
in actual use. No effort has been made to wrest grammat-
ical drill from the hands of the teacher, nor to deprive him
of ample leeway for the illustration and elucidation oi the
subject-matter. The translations suggested aim to lead the
pupil into the paths of respectable English, and to prevent
the disastrous persistence of crude impressions‚ received
while his mind was groping for ideas 'in a wilderness of
unfamiliar words. The student will find quite enough ma-
terial left for the exercise of his own powers.
