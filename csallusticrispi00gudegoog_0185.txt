NOTES ¹3¹

Cp. note ch. 18, 6. It was to lodge a complaint of precisely this nature
that the ambassadors of the Allobroges had come to Rome. Such
crimes, Cato means to say, cannot be leisurely dealt with, in accordance
with the regular process of the law, when, as now, life and property are
in jeopardy.-The genitive is objective.

(b.) ll. 22-42: My criticism af the moral corruption, amid which we
live, has passed unheea'ed, but now we must act mergetically, far
mercy to these malefactars surely invites destruction.

22. Saepenumero: Cato was at this time tribune-elect and only
thirty-two years of age. He can therefore hardly have been active as
the censor of his elder fellow senators for so long a time as is here inti-
mated.

23. luxuria . . . avaritia: it is upon these two vices that Sallust
in ch. 1-13 so often dwells.

24. ea causa for the more usual ea de causa.

25. mibi, in act, as opposed to aniate, in thought.

26. fecissem: a causal subjunct. in a relative clause does not occur
elsewhere in Sallust—In accordance with the rigorous moral code of
the Stoics, to which sect Cato belonged, he had never condoned his own
delinquencies. So much the more inexorable would he therefore naturally
be toward the misdeeds oi otherS, that were the result of evil propen-
sities.

27. lubidini: e'n view of the licentiaus character as another. 1t is
a kind of dative of reference (ἓ 17).

29. opulentia, etc.: the wealth of resources which Rome enjoyed
had enabled the state hitherto to withstand the demoralizing effects of
extravagance and greed.

31. bonisne . . . sit, eto: this is in answer to Caesar's remarks in
ch. 51, 132-135.

32. haec: i. e. the size and grandeur of Rome (quantum . . .
magnifieum), hence the neuter plural.

33. hostium: genitive of possession. The use of the word here is
significant, for, as Catiline had already been officially declared to bea
hostis (ch. 36, 6), his accomplices were virtually so too ; they, therefore,
as such forfeited alike all claims to mercy, and the protection of the
law, which, as Caesar had pointed out, prohibited the summary execu-
tion of a Roman citizen.

35. Hic . . . nominat? The indignant question inrpliesanegative
answer, hence quisquam for aliquis-In employing the words leniency
and mercy, Cato doubtless aimed primarily at Caesar, but the conspicu-
