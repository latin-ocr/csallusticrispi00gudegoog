124 NOTES

3¹· composite . . . magnifice: in well-worded ared eloquent
phrases. The same compliment is paid by Cato to this very speech of
Caesar's. But see note ch. 52, 43.

32. esset . . . acciderent: subjunct. in indit. question.

33. rapi, etc. ε The six infinit. are in apposition to quoe . . . acci-
derent, and depend upon enumeravero-virgines pueros: observe the
artistic grouping oi the subjeots and predicates in this sentence ι p : ss : :
p:szzsxp::s-i-s:p::sszp::s:p.

36. cadaveribus atque luctu: although the usual principle fol-
lowed by Sallust in asyndeticcombinations is here preserved (a ι a z b÷b),
luctu gives the result of the three preceding concrete nouns, atque being
thus frequently used after an asyndeton in an explanatory sense, in sine.

See note ch. 48, 7.
38. illa=illorum, refers back to plerique, etc-An: The first

member of the question is often omitted, when the speaker wishes to

ignore the other alternative.
39. faceret : subiunct. of purpose, depending upon some phrase like

orationem hahuerunt, easily supplied from the preceding-Scilicet: to
he sure. Strongly ironical.

(d.) ll. 44-57: Men in high positions, owing to the puhlirity that at·
tends their doings, shonhi ever act with calm deliberatian.

44. alia, etc.: cp. the saying cum duo idom sariunt, nonest idem.
Office begets responsibility and with it conservative tendencies, a truth
frequently illustrated in American political history.

45. quid: adverbial accus, after intrans. verbs is esp. common with
pronouns.-iracundia: ablat. of cause.

47. in excelso opposed to demissi rather than to in obscuro.

51. ehoe, i. e. qui demissi, etc.

55. et: often introduces an explanation ol what precedes here post
rema meminere, and is, therefore, almost equivalent to thot is to say.
They will not examine into the justice of the punishment, but will only
look at the inherent cruelty involved in its infliction.

(e.) ll. 58-81: The motion of Silanus, though prompted by patriotic
motives, is in realint based upon fear or indignation, but in view
os the efficiency os the cousul the former is graundless. On the
ather hand, in suggesting the death penalty, na adequate punish·
ment is deoised, since according to the true philosophy death is not
an evil, nar da the existing lacos justify this motion.

58. D. Silanum . . . dixisse: note the emphatic word order.
59. quae dixerit: subjunct. of indir. discourse implied in dixisse.
