A History of Roman Literature.

By HnRorm N. Fowtuu, Ph.D. (Bonn), Profes-
sor in the College lor Women ol Western Reserve
University; Editor ol Thucydides, Plautus, Quin-
tus CurtiuS, etc: Associate Editor, American ’
Journal ol Archaeology. Cloth, 3140 net, postpaid.

The acknowledged excellence ol Professor Fow-
ler's History ol Greek Literature‚ published in 1902,
will insure the present volume an immediate welcome
and recognition. Itis similar in method and treat-
ment to its companion volume, but is kept within a
somewhat less compass. lt contains a continuous
account ol the progressos Roman literature, with
biographical sketches of the writers, from Livius
Andronicus to Boethius. The numerous selections
from the works of the Roman writers are given for
the most part in English translations, because so
many ol those who may use the book read Latin with
difficulty, or not at all, that selections in the original
would be ol little use. Moreover, excellent books ol
selections in Latin are easily accessible, such as

' Cruttwell and Banton’s Specimens os Roman Litera·

ture, Tyrrell’s Anthology of Latin Poetry, and Gude-
man's Latin Literature of tlte Empirc. As compared
with other short histories of Roman literature, this
book is distinguished for its completeness and lor
the large number ol selections lrom the works ol the
ancient authors. Several portraits ol distinguished
· Romans also add an interesting feature to the work.
