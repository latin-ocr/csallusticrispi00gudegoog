Nonus 59

oiten in Sallust expressed in order to emphasize his own convictions, as
contrasted with those oi others. Possibly he had definite persons or
’ writers in mind who, like some scholars oi today‚ thought that the

15. iscium, subj. aiter priusquam (ἓ 61).

Ch. v, 1-20: Tim culmem or Carinus.

This famous passage was repeatedly imitated by later Roman writers.
The omission oi the conjunctions throughout gives an admirable con·
ciseness to the picture, the various traits following each other iu rapid
succession, thus iurnishing a good illustration oi the ⁴ immortal swiit-
ness' which an ancient critic predicates oi the style oi this author. The
truth oi the portrait has olten been called into question, although it
agrees in its main features with that drawn by Cicero, who was, how-
ever, uot an unprejudiced witness in this case, but cp. Introd. p. xvi.

wars between Marius, Cinna and Sulla, and to the revolt oi Lepidus. Dur-

-caedes : From other sources we learn that he murdercd his brother, ·
his brother-in-law, also one M. Marius Gratidianus. who was a distant
relative oi Cicero, and finally his own son. Only the last oi these crimes

N ο direct instances oi this are recorded ior the early career oi Catiline,
and they may have been added lor the salre oi rounding out a picture oi
utmost depravity. The conditions under Sulla afiorded, however,
ampie opportunities oi the kind here mentioned. When Catiline was
accused oi extortion and oi participating in the so-called first conspiracy
(see ch. 18), he had reached the age oi iorty-three.

4. ibique: etin eis rebus.

5. inediae, etc. : the three genit. depend upon patiens (ᾖ 28).

6. supra quam, beyond what, quam being used because oi the com-

parative idea in supra. The latter combined with credibile is equivalent
to incredibile, hence the negative cuiquam ior alicui.

7. cuius rei lubet = cuiuslubet rei. This separation (tmesis) is
iound only here-simulator. . . dissimulator: the former claims
