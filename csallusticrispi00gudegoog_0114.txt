60 NOTES

8. alieni. . . sui: neuter adj. used substantively. The genitive
with adpetens and profusus happens to be found only here.

9. satis . . . parumsc. ei erat: the genitives are partitive (ἓ 24).
Observe the double chiasmus in sui . . . parum (abt ab: ba: : a: b:
bza).

12. hunc in emphatic position like mein ch. 3, 19.-post domina·
tionem Sullae: see Index of Names. On the vagueness of the chro-
nology, see Introd. p. xv. Here post may refer to any time between 80
and 65 B. e.

13. rei publicae capiundae is intentionally taken ont ol its proper
position after lubido, in order to emphasize the fact that this was the
particular form which inmoderata . . . cupiebat now assumed.

14. adsequeretur: deliberative subj. in indirect question, with quic·
quam pensi habebar-dum with the subj.‚ because it expresses a desire,
the tense being determined by the principal verb (g 74).

15. pensi, a partitive genitive, is, with but lew exceptions in later
writers, always dependent upon a word like quicquam or nihil. lt is
a colloquial expression which, as its etymology implies, must date back
to a time when most commodities were still estimated by actual werga-
ing.-agitabatur. . . incitabant: The initial position of the predi-
cate is a favorite device for imparting emphasis. To preserve this in
translating, the construction must be changed.

16. inopia . . . conscientia: abl. of cause (ξ 34).

17. quae utraque: the nent. plur. after two feminine nouns, though
not rare, is here justified, because the antecedents are strictly the nouns
with their modifica-supra memoravi: the reference is more particu-
larly to caedes (l. 3) and sui profusus (1.8), the former resulting in the
’ recognition of the enormity of his crimes, the latter causing his straitened
circumstances.

18. incitabant, etc. Translate: He was, morentur, spurred on by
the corrupted state os public morals which rte worst and opposite evils,
nantely extravagance and greed, were continually imperilling. The⁸rel-
ative refers only to mores as a partial antecedent, a usage quite com-
mon elsewhere. lt is, however, equally possible to supply cives after
quos, to be taken out of civitatis, a so-called construction according to
sense, as in ch. 16, 1; 17, 25. The formeria, however, preferable. A
very similar sentiment is attributed to the elder Cato, and Sallust may
have taken it from him. It was apparently introduced to serve as a peg
upon which to hang the long digression that follows.
