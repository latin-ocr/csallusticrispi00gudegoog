NOTES

XIX

ι. quaestor pro praefore: It was customary to send ex-praetors
and consuls as govemors to the provinces. Occasionally even lower
magistrates might be invested with praetorian authority and, as in the
present instance, put in charge of some province within a very short
time after their abdication.

2. adnitente Crasso, eta: the motive here assigned to Crassns’s
strong support of Piso and the attempt to exonerate him of any share in
the Catilinian conspiracy seem to imply Sallust's ignorance ol the above·
mentioned version of the story (ch. 18, 23).

3. infestum, inimicum: on the alliterative combination of synonyms,
cp. note ch. 1,11.-Cn. Pompeio: on Sallust's attitude toward him, see
Introd. p. xvi.

6. boni is here used in its technical sense of the nobility or conserva-
tive party. They thought that Piso might prove a formidabis obstacle
to the realization ol Pompey’s ambitions. In reality, though the latter's
recent victories doubtless made him a popular hero, he always posed as
a champion of the senatorial party-praesidium sc. sora-in eo:
i. e. Piso.

7. et: and, in fact.

10. sunt qui dicunt . . . alii :alii . . . alii sc. dicunt. On the
indicat. after sunt qui, instead of the subjunct. of characteristic, see
563.

dactylic hexameter (--, - —, - ν υ, - -, ·- νυ, - -).
Rhythm was demanded of an artistic style, but verses in prose were con-
sidered a blemish. The present line, however, like most others that
have been discovered in Greelr and Latin prose, would not have been
noticed by Roman readers, because it occurs in the midst of a sentence.

-clientis: it was customary for whole communities and individual for-
eigners to place themselves under the protectlon of some influential
Roman, who, as their patron, guarded their interests in case ol an emer·
gency. Thus Fabius Sanga was the patron ol the Allobroges (ch. 41,
7). Pompey, while in Spain (76-72 13. c.), had secured many benefits to
the people among whom Piso was sent.

13. adgressos sc. esse: acc. with inf., after alii (sc. dicunt).

14. imperia saeva multe: note the strongly emphatic word-order
for multa et saeva imperia.

15. in medio relinquemus: S. professes himself unable to decide,

Α whether the Spanish knights murdered Piso on their own initiative or
because they believed that Pompey would be grateful to them for having
