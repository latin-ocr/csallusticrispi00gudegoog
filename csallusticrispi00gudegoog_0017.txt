I. LIFE OF SALLUST¹

C. Samusrms Cmsaus was born in 86 a. c. in Ami-

accusations, even though they be not intrinsically improbable, happen to
be confirmed by other writers os recognized veracity and impartiality.

’Sallustius Crispus. his nephew and heir, was a friend of the poet
Horace and an intimate associate ol Augustus and his family.
