veterans. This difficult mission proved fruitless; in fact,
he barely escaped being killed by the iniuriated sol-
diers. Caesar thereupon sent Sallust to Africa, and this
time the future historian was more successful, for by
seizing the island of Cercina, an important grain depot of
the enemy, and thus cutting off their supplies, he mate-

as a reward for these services he was appointed by Caesar
as the first pro-consul of the newly organized province,
New Africa. It was during the brief incumbency of this
office that he succeeded, by means of unscrupulous ex-

Nerva, and Aurelian.

Sallust retired to private life on the expiration of his
term of office, or, at any rate, immediately after the assas-

He died in 35-4 Β. c., or about four years before Au-
gustus, by his decisive victory at Actium over the forces
of Antony and Cleopatra, became the undisputed ruler
of the Roman world.

Of his later life we know nothing except what he tells
us himself in the introductory chapters of his Catilina.
He is said by alate writer to have married Terentia, the
divorced wife of Cicero; but this story seems like an
invention facetiously concocted to accentuate the bitter
feud which, it is alleged, existed between the orator and
the historian. That Sallust was not on friendly terms
with Cicero, who defended Milo in the trial for the murder
