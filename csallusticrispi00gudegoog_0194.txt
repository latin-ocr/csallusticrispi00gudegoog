140 NOlPES

4. tresviros: sc. capitales. These minor magistrates were elected
annually, and had, apert irom certain police duties, special charge oi
prisons and executions, the latter, however, were generally delegated to
subordinates, the vindices rerum capitalium mentioned below.

5. ceteris: probably dative, though the ablat. oi means with facere
is also used. In Sallust only indecisive plural forms occur.

6. in carcere: this famous prison, situated on the north side oi the
Forum, and believed by the Romans to date back to king Ancus Mar·
tius, still exists, and the very spot where the Catilinian conspirators and
Jugurtha were strangled and St. Peter was placed in chains is still
pointed out to the visitor. According to a mediaeval legend St.
Peter converted his keepers and numerous lellow prisoners, a spring rni-
raculously arising to iumish the baptismal water. The little churoh
now standing over the ancient dungeon commemorates the event. The
prison itsell contains two chambers oi different size, one above the other.
It was into the lower and smaller one, or Tullianum, that those convicted

were let down through a manhole in the centre oi the vaulted ceiling. '

It served originally as a well-house, whence its name, ior tullius was an
old Latin word ior aspring, though the Romans themselves, owing to
the resemblance, connected it with Servius Tullius, the fiith iring oi
Rome. The architecture attests its hoary antiquity, lor the builders were
still ignorant oi the principle oi the arch. The description oi Sallust
is periectly clear except ior the words ascenderis ad laevam which can-
nothe reconciled with the existing remains. See the illustration on
P· 44·

7. ascenderis: subjunct. oi the iudei. second pers. sing. (ἓ 76).

8. humi depressus: i. e. beneath the floor oi the upper chamber,
which is oi much later origin.

ιο. fornicibus: the word is here somewhat loosely used, ior it is
notan arch proper, buta vault oi conical shape. Sallust was no trained
archaeological observes-incultu, etc: causal ablatives.

11. foeda . . . terribilis: to he taken as predicates.

14. clarissuma: a genuine, not a complimentary superlative, ior
in the number ol its illustrious men, the gens Cornelia was undoubtedly
the most prominent in Roman history. Thus the Scipios, the Gracchi
and Sulla belonged to it.

15. consulare imperium: he was consul in 71 s. c.

16. exitium, archaic ior exitum-Cicero is said to have an-
· nounced the execution to the expectant multitude with the single word,
vixerunt.
