But, scanty as these remains are, their stylistic art, the
skill of sustained characterization, the care with which the
utterances put into the mouth of the speakers are ad-

If we except the captious and biased criticism of a
contemporary rhetorician‚ that Sallust was read only for
the sake of the speeches in his historieS, the verdict of
antiquity is unanimous in assigning to him the very first
