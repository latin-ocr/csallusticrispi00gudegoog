NOTES ¹43

23. huiusce modi, etc.: ancient historiens habitually put a speech
into the mouth ol a commanding general on the eve ol an important
battle. Both in style and contents such speeches are almost without
exception the historian's own compositions, lor the contingencv oi his
having possessed some authentic information regarding their contents,
even where the actual delivery ol a speech was a matter ol historical
record, was more remote than in the case ol the other orations inserted
in their works. The present speech, accordingly, exhibits no such pecu-
liarities ol diction as the genuine letter ol Catiline cited in ch. 35, and
many ol its sentiments are the traditional stock-in-trade oi military
speeches both in Greek and Roman historians. Asa specin'ren ol the
author’s rhetorical skill the present address ments high praise, it
being in perlect keeping with the situation and the character ol the
speaker.

12. dum . . . opperior: although Sallust is exceedinglylond ol
the indicative in oratio obliqua, this mood is necessary here, ior the

14. iuxta mecum: as well as I, an archaic and colloquial expres-
sion.
