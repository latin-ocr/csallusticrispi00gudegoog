in one whose mind dwelt so fondly in an idealized past,
and it was equally shared by his contemporaries, the
learned Varro and the versatile Asinius Pollio, the friend
of Horace and Virgil. The enemies of Sallust remarked
upon this tendency in a carping spirit. One of them, a
certain Lennaeus, in revenge, it is alleged, for the his-
torian’s hostile attitude toward Pompey, stigmatized him
as “an ignorant thief of the language of Cat0‚” and even
Polli0, though his own style is said to have been so
archaic that it seemed as if the author had lived a hun-
dred years previous, asserted that Ateius Praetextatus,
sumamed Philologus, had compiled a collection of
archaisms for Sallust’s special benefit. The charges put
in this form are undoubtedly slanderous, but they reflect
the fact of the historian's fondness for old forms, which
was too conspicuous a feature to escape hotice. But
many of these so-called archaisms, though banished from
elevated and artistic prose, doubtless survived in the lan·
guage of daily life, it being often impossible to draw a
hard and fast line of demarcation between an archaism
and a colloquialism. By drawing from this fountain, Sal-
lust eamed the title of an innovator, although we probably
should discover, if our knowledge of archaic and collo-
quial Latin were more extensive than it is, that he had
in numerous instances merely rehabilitated old and dis-
carded expressions.¹ Of the more noteworthy archaisms
or colloquialisms to which attention is directed in the

1Ιιι keeping with this archaizing tendency is the spelling which
Sallust appears to have adopted, although our Mss, upon which we
must mainly rely for the evidence, are neither trustworthy nor consistent
in such matters. The orthography of his time, moreover, was in a transi·
tionaf state, and there is no reason to believe that he himself observed
a rigid uniformity. He seems, however, to have preferred u for i in
such words as optumus, lacruma, lubet, o for u in walgras, o for e in
varta, voster, advorsus, and he possibly wrote ignavos, novos for ignavus,
novus, aud the like.
