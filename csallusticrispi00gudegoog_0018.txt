severely chastised lor an intrigue with'Milo's wile by the
wronged husband himself. That Sallust spent his youth
in riotous debauchery is stated without qualification in
the Invective referred to, and his expulsion from the Sen-
ate (in 5013. e.) by the censor Appius Claudius on this

years previous been ignominiously expelled. Shortly
after Sallust was called upon to quell a mutiny ol Caesar's
