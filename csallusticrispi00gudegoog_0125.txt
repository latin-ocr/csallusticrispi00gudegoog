Novus 71

general lethargy and indolence which, according to the proverb, is the
mother oi all crime-luxu: ablat. oi means (ὅ 33).

12. Haec: these practices.

13. facinora is here, as the context shows, used in its bad sense,
hence a defining attribute was unnecessary. Cp. note ch. 11, 7.

14. artibus: ablat. oi means—lubidinibus: acts os licentiousness.
-eot therefore.

XIV

Ch. xlv-xvi: Cnrnrrve’s anomalae assocmras ann ins ennean
on canna nun connurrron.

The very first sentence skiltully justifies the preceding digression by
intimating that Catiline was but the inevitable outgrowth oi the degen-
erate conditions described, and that his nelarious schemes were hence
sure to meet with ready acquiescence and support.

2. flagitiorum . . . facinorum, a favorite alliterative combination
ol synonyms. The personification is no holder than pietate . . . gloria
(ch. 12, 12) andis here somewhat lessened by the apologetic tamquam.

4. aleator irom alea, ‘die' The throwing oi dice was the only
regular gambling game known to the ancients.

5. manu, etc: The three abl. ol means (ἓ 33) correspond in in-
verse order (abc : cba) to the preceding nominatives. Tr.: Eaery rahe,
glutian, garnbler talea lead by tlte exereise as his hand, lais grass appetites,
his profligacy.-pattia: adject.

⁶. alienum aes grande: The expression ior debt in Latin is aes
alienum, which, as a rule, was as fixed as res publica or papulus Rama-
nus. Sallust has here, however, boldly changed the order to avoid the
juxtaposition ol the two adjectives, the other alternative, grande aes
alienum, being rejected, because he desired to emphasize alienum rather
than grande. When no attributive is added the regular lorm is always
¹ retained, as in ch. 16, 10, 40, 20; 41, 1. Such apparently trivial
observations effectively illustrate the minute care which great classical
writers bestowed upon their compositions.-quo = ut ea.

8. iudiciis: abl. ol means (ἓ 33). Observe the distinction between
the plur. in caurts af law, and the sing„ prosecutian.

9. adhoc, mareaaer, one ol Sallust's lavorite expressions—manus
. . . sanguine: chiasmus, lor periuria refers to lingua.

11. conscius animus: This, not canscientia (see below ch. 15, 11),
is the more idiomatic equivalent lor Engl. ‘conscience,' aterni also
primarily used with reference to guilt.

14. inciderat: This verb always implies an unexpected occurrence.
