to the silver sestertius (4c.), which inflation enabled the insolvent debtor '

to settle on a 25ss basis-memoria: abl. of time (ἓ 42).
16. Saepe, etc: three secessions of the plebs are recorded in Ro·

man history. T he first in 494 Β. e. to the Mons Sacer ended in their se-
curing from the nobles the tribuneship‚ the second in 449, to the Aventine
Hill, was occasioned by the overbearing conduct (hence superbia magis-
tratuum) ol the Decemviri under the leadership of Appius Claudius. It
was also a victory for the people, the oppressors being forced to resign.
In the last, in 287 Β. c., they withdrew to the Janicuium Hill and again
the patricians yielded by passing a law which provided that the resolu-
tions of the people (plebiscita) should have the same binding force as
the decrees of the aristocratic senate. The first and last secession,
though originating in economic distress, ended in giving to the people a
voice in the govemment. In attributing an ambition to rule as their real
motive, Manlius desires to soften the impeacbment of the nobility implied
in the succeeding statement, a patribus, for a patriciis, serving the same

conciliatory purpose.

19. divitias l. e. they desired only enough to satisfy their creditors.
With the entire sentiment, cp. ch. 10, 8 ff.

²3· consulatis. . . restituatis . . . imponetis: Subjunct. in
substantive clause developed from Volitive (ἕ 64).

25. ut quaeramus: subjunct. of purpose (ἓ 64).

26. sanguinem nostrum, an emphatic substitute lornos, as animus

is for ego (ch. 20, 12).-pereamus: a dependent deliberative question
(ἓ 52), though syntactically an indirect question, for the subjunct. would
also have been used in oratio recta.

1. sivellent . . . discedent . . . proficiscantur: The historical

present (respondet) is treated as a secondary tense with the conditional
protasis, butas a primary tense with the other verbs, for the imperfect

would have weakened their imperative force. Cp. note ch. 32, 9. Ι
3. mansuetudine . . . misericordia: ablat. of quality used as

predicate (ἓ 38). This alliterative combination occurs very frequently.
5. petiverit: we should expect peteret according to the sequence of
tenses but in Result clauses the perfect is occasionally used like the
Greek Aorist or Perf. Indict. in a direct statement without reference to
the continuity of the fact.
7. optumo cuique :optumis-se . . . cedere. . . proficisci:
the acc. with inf. depends upon the verb of saying implied iu litteras mit·

it. Cp. note ch. 21, q.
