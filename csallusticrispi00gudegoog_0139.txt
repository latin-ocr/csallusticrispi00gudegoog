4. docta here takes the ablat. ol specification, then the infinit, a
poetic usage, and finally the accusat, the regular construction—He

Greek literature-psallere includes both singing,and playing on the
lyre.

5. elegantius: not elegant, but according to all the rules ol the art. .

atque being, as olten, explanatory. On the sing. predicate, see note ch.
3, 21.—praeceps: adverb.

13. absurdum sc. erat: an imperi, followedby historical infinitives
and again closing with an imperi„ is a lavorite Sallustian device. See
ch.60, 13.

ch. 2, 7.-Note the art with which this entire paragraph is composed.

conduct, which is treated under two aspectS, and ends as he had begun,
with a tribute to her intellectual gilts. the praiseworthy characteristics,
however, being in each case, slightly modified (elegantius, etc., and
procaci).
