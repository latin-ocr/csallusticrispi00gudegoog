5. luxuria. . . avaritia cum superbia here with a plural predi-
cate, because cum superbia virtually amounts to a third subject. See
note ch. 2, 17 and cp. ch. 43, 1, Lentulus cum ceteris . . . constituerant
(= l„ et cetere).—rapere, etc: historical infinit, habere being omitted
alter promiscua to avoid the close repetition of the same verb. The
