NOTES 105

tium . . . modum: the tormer, a feeling ol proper restraint, usually
with an ethical sense implied, is here significantly denied to the popular
leaders, since from an aristocratic point ol view their power was an un·
due usurpation. Laetor naudus, on the other hand, is the same re·
straint regarded merely in the light of an external act, a transgression

beyond the proper bonnds, due to excessivo zeal or anger or the lihe, for
senatorial supremacy, whether urged asa screen ior personal ambition

or not, was the traditional policy and conviction ol the nobility. Both
words are combined in ch. 11, 13 and elsewhere, but without being so
clearly differentiated in meaning as here—utrique = uterque, see note
ch.5,17; 30,1o.

15. victoriam crudeliter exercebant: No illustrations ol this are
known lor the years between 70-67, oi which Sallust has been speaking
in this chapter, but they are not wanting lor the previous and subse-
quent periods. Cp. especially the history oi the Gracchi, Marius, Cinna,
Sulla, Jugurtha, Lentulus and Catulus, Clodius and Milo, Pompey and

Caesar.

XXXIX

1. bellum maritumum: 67 n. c.—Mithridaticum: 66 n. c.

3. paucorum, etc.: the word is often used oi an oligarchy or the
nobility, as opposed to,the commons (cp. ch. 20, 20 and esp. 30, 12).
Whom Sallust had in mind, it is difficult to say, particularly as the state-
ment itsell is extremely questionable. Perhaps Crassus, the two Luculli
Catulus, Philippus, Q. Metellus Creticus (ch. 30) were among them.
Most of these probably belonged to the ‘seven tyrants’ alluded to by
Cicero in a speech ol the year 63. As already remarlred, Pompey was
still in the East, and the senatorial party was not lavorably disposed

toward him at this time-magistratus: accusat. plur.
4. innoxii: unmolestcd. The passive sense oi this word is very

rarely found.
5. sine metu: a substitute lor the missing negative adject. See

note ch. ό, 4.-agere. . . terrere: histor. infinit—ceterosque:
but the others, que being olten used in an adversative sense. The reler-
ence is apparently to those nobles who did not belong to this political

ring. Having silenced the opposition by threats ol prosecutions and
being thus freed from agitators, they could assume a conciliatory

policy toward the people. The allusion cannot be to the tribunes, lor
these are not included among the magistratus, nor could they be prose-

cuted while in office.
7. tractarent: purpose clause with quo (ἓ ort-dubiis rebus: a

loose use ol the ablat. oi manner (ἓ 35).-novandi, revolution, used
