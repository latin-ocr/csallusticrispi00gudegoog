NOTES Ι23

ably reflects the official tradition—bellis Punicis omnibus: the three
Punic wass lasted from 264-241, 218-201 and 149·14⁶ a. e. It was in
the third, especially, which ended with the destruction oi Carthage, and
in the events that led up to it, that the Romans themselves were guilty
oi the perfidious character here attributed to their enemies. This demon-
strably false charge was so persistently made against the Carthaginians
that Punica fides became proverbial ior treacherous conduct in gen-

eralia. multa nefaria facinora: multa et would be more idiomatic,

but nefaria facinora virtually forms one word, being equivalent to
‘scelera or flagitia. The etymological figure facinora jecissent, while
especially frequent in Sallust, never occurs in &esan-iecissent: con-

cessive cum subjunctive (ἓ 65).
21. se=maioribus nostrin-toret . . . posset: subjunct. in indi-
rect question.

(b.) ll. 23-29: The same altitude should be observed toward Lentulus
and leis sellow conspirators.

24. valeat . . . consulatis: subjunctive developed irorn the Voli-
tive, neu, aud that not, regularly following in a second clause (g 64).
consulatis, look to, belongs, strictly speaking, only to samoe and must be

taken, by the figure called neugma, with irae in the sense oi gratisy.
27. pro tactis: dignus, though generally used with an ablat. ol re-

spect, here takes the preposition to define the conception more closely.
Transl. commensurate raith or adequati tn—novum consilium: Capital
punishment oi a Roman citizen could legally be inflicted only by a direct
vote oi the people and hence the senate was in reality transcending its
prerogatives. The argument is nevertheless sophistical, ior though Caesar
admits that the death penalty would be deserved‚ he still advocates the
milder punishment, because the law did not contain specific provisions

to meet the present case.

28. ingenia exsuperant: i. e. no penalty that human ingenuity
could devise would be a sufficient atonement ior their deeds.

29. utendum, sc. esse nobis. In the passive gerundive construction,
intransitive verbs can be used only impersonally, but admit their ordinary
case construction (eis, ablat). utar was, however, originally transitive.

(c). ll. 30-43: T ke previous speakers superfluously depicted in rhetor·
ital colors tlte direfui consequencrs of the success of tte conspiracy,
for every oue understands tlte present situation.

30. Plerique: we know oi at least sixteen senators who spoke belore
Caesar, and they without exception advocated the death penalty proposed
by Silanus, the first speaker.
