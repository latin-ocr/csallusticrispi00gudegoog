36. largiri . . . liberalitas: the infinit. is the subject, the noun
the predicate. The entire sentiment is modeled upon a passage ol the
Greek historian Thucydides (III 82, 4).

38. sint: concessive subjunct. (ᾖ 65), but with cutting sarcasm.

“ 39. liberales, etc. : Let them make free with tlte fortunes.
