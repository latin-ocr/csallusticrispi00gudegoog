absol. at the beginning especial emphasis is imparted to it. That such
an inference was quite justifiable may be seen from the attitude of the
second class of senators mentioned above (pars . . . videbatur).

37. suscepto . . . patrocinio: This trait is also recorded in Plu-
tarch’s Life of Crassus

38. conturbaret: subjunct. oi purpose (ὅ 64).—ipsum Crassum:
this is the only passage in which Sallust directly alludes to any of his
sources of information. Cicero and Crassus were not on good terms‚
but from what we learn from other writers, Crassus was wrong in his
suspicion. On the other hand, it seems equally well established, that
he was not in any truc sense implicated in the conspiracy itself. Cp.
note ch. 17, τι.

XLIX

(8.) Ch. xlix: The alleged complicity of Caesar.

1. Q. Catulus: The disreputable means he is here said to have
Ι taken to revenge himself upon Caesar for his deleat as pontifex maximus
is quite incompatible with the uprightness of his character known to us
from other sources, Sallust, besides being a strong partisan of Caesar,
may also have had a private grievance against this enemy ol his patron,
but it is more likely that he is here merely recording malicious contem-
porary gossip, based upon a widely current conviction that Caesar was
not an entire stranger to the designs of the conspirators. The question .
of his complicity can no longer be definitely determined, but apart from
other considerations, the fact that Cicero in a speech ol the following
year expressly exculpates him ought to weigh even more strongly in his
favor than Cicero's refusal to implicate him here, for it would have been
unwise to offend a man of Caesar‘s influence at this juncture of affairs,
even had the evidence of his guilt been clearer than it apparently was

3. quivere, from queo, an archaic form for potuere expressly attested
for this passage of Sallust by an ancient writer.

4. uterque: the only passage in Sallust in which this pronoun is
construed with a plural verb, though commonly so elsewhere.

5. Piso, etc: in the year of the conspiracy (63 Β. e.) he had been
accused of extortion by the Allobroges, Caesar as one of the patrons of
the province charging him in addition with the unjust execution of a
Gaul. Piso was defended by Cicero and acquitted, the speech being still
extant. He was a persistent enemy ol Caesar and, even on Cicero'sown
showing, not a man of exemplary character or of noteworthy abilities.

7. ex petitione, etc.: this defeat took place March, 63 e. e.

8. extrema aetate: this statement, like adulescentulus, possibly
