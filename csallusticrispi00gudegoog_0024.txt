xvi INTRODUCTION

the mouth of Catilina, of Caesar, and of Cato are purely
fictitious and not strictly in keeping either with the situa-
tion or the character of the speakers3 that, in a word, the
truth of history is sacrificed'to rhetorical embellishment
and partizan bias.

But this conclusion, even if the bulk of these charges
could be substantiated,·would nevertheless be unwar-
ranted, for absolute objectivity in historical narrative is
a beautiful but unattainable ideal, human nature being
what it is. Hence no writer, particularly if he was him-
self acquainted with the leaders in the events to be de·

, scribcd, and had taken an active part in the politics of

his time, has ever remained uninfluenced, to some de-
gree at least, by his environment and his settled con-
victions Sallust had allied himself from the beginning
with the popular party, under the leadership of Caesar.
His hostility to Pompey was genuine and warmly recip-
rocated by the latter’s followers¹ On the other hand,
his opposition to Cicero (in 52 B. e.) did not, as we have
seen, blind him to the orator’s solid achievements in
crushin'g the conspiracy. That Sallust was tempted to
vindicate the character of the dictator shortly after his
assassination in connection with an event which in the
light of Caesar's subsequent career must have paled
into supreme insignificance, is inherently improbable.
The exculpation of both Caesar and Crassus is quite inci-
dental to the story of the Conspiracy, and may well have
been the outcome of sincere conviction on the part of the

writer. Catiline, it is true, is painted in dark colors, and

his actions are placed in a dramatic setting by means of
speeches and an effective grouping of incidents and yet
the story, as narrated by him, does not differ essentially
from the account of Cicero and later writers, and it must
therefore be considered in its main outlines as fairly re-
flecting the truth of history as it appeared to contem·
