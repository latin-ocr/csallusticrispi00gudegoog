NOTES ¹²5 ,,

60. eos . . . earn: such. The pronouns though the predicates,
are by a favorite Latin idiom attracted to the nouns (here the sub-
ject accusat. of esse understood), and hence placed in attributive posi-
tion.

⁶4. metust fear of the result, if the prisoners were merely imprisoned
or exiled—iniuria: here used in its original sense of injustice or viola·
tion of the law, involved in the conspiracy, which feeling prompted him
to propose the death sentence as the only proper punishment. The other
meanings generally given to the term bere would destroy the evident con-
trast with studio, etc., and gratiam, etc.

⁶8. praesidia: again refers, of course, to the military prepara-
tions made by Cicero to crush the rebellion, not to the guards stationed
about the senate chamber. See note ch. 50, 22.

69. equidem, ete: this emphatic expression reflects the feeling that
his hearers would not expect a pontifex maximus to state his belief in
the Epicurean doctrine oi the mortality of the soul and the utter annihi-
lation of the body after death.

74. prius, etc: as death is not cruciatus, flogging ought to pre-
cede the execution, for this would not be cruel in the case of such
malefactors.

75. lex Porcia, etc. : there were three laws under this name which
belong to the middle of the ad cent. u. c. They inflicted a heavy pen· '
alty upon the flogging' or executing of a Roman citizen, if done in dis-
regard oi the right of appeal to the people on the part ol the accused.
The exact provisions ol these enactments, as well as their precise rela-
tion to other legislation (aliae leges), such as the Valerian, dating back
to the beginning of the 5th cent. Β. c, and to the law of C. Gracchus
(121 Β. c.) are unknown. It seems, however, that at this time the right
of going into exile had generally been substituted for capital punishment.
The inconsistency in Silanus' proposal is, therefore, made to consist in
this: (1) that he made an illegal proposition ; (a) if he merely omitted
flogging, as being too cruel, he minimized the atrocity of the crime ; if,
on the other hand, he thought death the more severe and hence the
more adequate penalty of the two, he all the more seriously violated
the law, particularly as the prisoners had not even been legally con-
victed altera regular trial, condemnati being tacitly contrasted with
indemnati-civibus: dative of separation with eripi, of indirect object
with permitti-animam, like ‘breath of life,' is more emphatic than
vitam.

80. qui, how? an old ablat. used adverbially.

81. neglegetis: an archaic form for neglexeris. The subjunct. is
causal (ᾖ 62).
