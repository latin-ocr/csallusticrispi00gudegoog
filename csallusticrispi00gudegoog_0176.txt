(a.) ll. 1-22: The expediency of moderation and sels-control in crit·
ical times is inculcated and illustrated by two exanrples from Ro-
man history.

t. patres conscripti. ior the original patres (patrician senators)
et conscripti (those enrolled lrom lower orders), was the traditional mode
oi addressing the senate.

3. misericordia: according to the unanimous verdict oi antiquity,
it was this particular quality which conspicuously characterized Caesar.

Here he is made to deprecate its possession only in rebus dubiis. Oi
the truth oi this the de bello Gallico furnishes abundant illustrationu-
As has been notieed repeatedly Sallust is lond ol the collocation (a a b
4- b), but no similar example occurs in Caesar.

4. illa: neuter plur., because the antecedentsare not all oi the same
gender.-neque quisquam omnium: no one ever. omnium is super-
fluous. but is added lor emphasis.

5. paruit: the socalled gnomic perfect, used in maxims or general
truths (ἓ 45).-iutenderis: subjunct. ol iudei. second pers. sing.
(so)-

6. valet se. animus. Sallust often puts the subject into the second

iearing that the result might prove disastrous to their flourishing trade,
threatened to make war upon the Romans themselves unless they agreed
to terms ol peace (infida, ete). The Romans. owing to the opposition
ol the elder Cato, did not, it is true, accept the challenge, but the Rho·
dians were deprived oi their possessions in Lycia and Caria (on the
coast ol Asia Minor) which in 19⁰ B. e. they had received asa reward
ior aiding the Romans against Antiochus 111, the king oi Syria (qnae
. . . creverat). By establishing a rival harbor on the island oi Delos,
moreover, the Rhodian commerce was all but ruined.

12. magna . . . magnifica: On the alliterative groupings oi syn·
onymous expressions, see note ch. 1, 11.

17. impunitos, etc. This contradicts the laets ol history, un-
