Although a steady development and improvement is
distinctly discernible even in what remains to us ol Sal-
lust's writings, certain salient characteristics ol his style
are already in evidence in his earliest treatise, the one
with which we are here more immediately concemed.
They may be conveniently grouped under the following
categories:

1. Concisrness of Expressionrlt was this feature that
especially attracted the attention ol the ancient critics.
One ol these styled Sallust subtilissimus brevitatis artifex,
and Quintilian, in a famous phrase, speaks ol his “ immor-
ἰαὶ swiftues5.” This rapidity ol movement was chiefly

secured by ellipsis, i. e., by the omission oi all particles‚ ¹

conjunctions (Asyudeton) and verb forms, principally ol
esse, wherever they could be readily supplied hyan atten-

tive reader. This tendency to conciseness shows itsell
further in the deliberate avoidance ol long and involved
periods, such as abound in Cicero and Livy. Sallust's
sentences are, as a rule, short and perspicuous in their

structure, which renders them peculiarly adapted to epi-
grammatic expression, neatly turned phrases, and effect-
ive antitheses Dreary monotony, unrelieved by flashes
ol lancy, figurative language, or lelicitous expression, .
seems to have characterized the style ol the Annalists, and

it was doubtless this lact that largely contributed to their ,

neglect. By the devices mentioned, Sallust endeavored
to avoid a similar late.

2. Archoisms and colloquialisms.—The second char-
acteristic oi Sallust’s style is his predilection lor archaic
lorms oi expression, by which is understood the choice ol
words or phrases common in older writers, but discarded
by the lastidious and puristic taste ol the Ciceronian and
Augustan age. This love ol archaisms is not surprising
