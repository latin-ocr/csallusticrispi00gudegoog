uorns 57

Sallust opposes the man oi action to the writer and hythe lorm ol the
expression haud absurdum (litotes) seems ta give preference to the lor-
mer. The entire sentenceis in chirstic arrangement, vel pace ael bella
referring to benefacere and bene dicere as well as to the relative clauses iol·
luwing, utrumque having to be supplied with fieri licet (a : b r: b z a ε :
a: b).-pace . . . bello: poetic ablat. ol time, the preposition in being
regularly omitted only when an attributive is added (ἓ 42). So elsewhere
in Sallust.

3. qui = earum qui. the subject multi being closely joined to the
predicate, according to the usage oi Sallust. Cp. note ch. 1. 14.

5. scriptorem. . . actorem corresporrd to qui secere. . . qui
. . . scripsere in inverse order (clriasmus).

⁶. ardurun . . . scribere: on the word order, see ch. 1, 8 rectius
videtur. . . quaerere.

7. dictis: ablat. oi means-The ancients regarded historical com·
position primarily as an art, not as a science, and hence they felt that
the character oi the subiect-matter must be reflected in the manner oi its
presentation. It is precisely this artistic elaboration, the indissoluble
association oi form and substance, that gives to the great classiaal
writers their imperishable charm.

8. quae = eaquae, the noun (delicta) being the predicate (‘ as laults’).
-reprehenderisz subjunct. ol iudei. ad pers. sing (ᾖ 48).

9. malevolentia.. . invidia: ablat. oi cause (ἓ sah—dicta sc.
esse.

ιο. memores: the subjunct. asin reprehenderis.

11. iactu: abl. oi supine (ἓ 84).-auirno: abl. oi manner (ἓ 35).-
supra ea,a concise expression lor ea quae supra sunt and object ol
ducit. Superiora had to be avoided because of its possible ambiguity
here.

13. plerique, many, not mast, as often. See Vocabatur-studio:
abl. of cause (ἓ 34).

14. mihi, dative with advorsa (ἓ 21). For the statement itselt. see
Introd. p. xi l.

15. pudore . . . avaritia: the various qualities are again pitted
against their oppositesiu regular order, except that Sallust opposes to
virtus, ‘worthy conduct in general‚' the specific vice which he considers
the most demoralizing. See· note ch. 2, 3.—Observe the omission oi the
coniunctiori et throughout (asyndeton). This is one ol the most charac-

' teristic features ol Sallust’s style.

17. animae, as often, is here equivalent to ega-artium: gen. with

insolens (ἓ 28).
18. vitia, i. e. those just enumerated.
