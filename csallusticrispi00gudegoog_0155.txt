CONSPIRACY.

11. urbi praesidio: double dative oi person and thing with esse,
for urbi is here equivalent to civibus. Cp. note ch. 31, 11.-lt would
seem from these resolutions that the extraordinary powers conterred by
the emergency decree, redeant consules, etc. (ch. 29, 7), did not include

the levying ol troops and the distribution oi the particular iunctions
which each consul was to assume.

13. multo, lor the more usual longe, emphasizes nraxume, which
with miserabile lorms asubstitute lor miserabilissimum, a superlative
avoided by careiul writers on account of its length-cum . . . pare·
rent . . . adfluerent: concessive subjunct. (5 65).-ad . . . solis:
the natural order is reversed lor the salre ol emphasis.

15. prima sc. essa-putant, adfluerent, fuere: the juxtaposition
of three verbs belonging to independent sentences is noteworthy and
generally avoided. Observe also that affluerent belongs, strictly speak-
ing, only with divitiae and not to otium which would call lor esset.

17. animis: abl. oi manner (ἓ 35).—perditum irent: the supine
in—um alter verbs oi motion expresses purpose, the subjunct. being
that ol characteristic alter suere qui (g 63).-namque, a stronger form
lor nam, explanatory oi obstinatis animis.

18. senati decretis: concessive abl. of manner ‘in spiteof’ (ᾖ 35).
The second decl. genit. oi senatus is in Sallust invariably used with
decretum.

19. patefecerat sc. quisquam. This shiiting oi the subject into
the second oi two clauses is a lavorite device in Latin. Cp. ch. 40, 4 ;
43, ao; 51, 6, 123.

21. uti = velut is oi rare occurrence-plerosque = multos, as often
in Sallust.

XXXVII

1. aliena: diseased (literally estranged). So, similarly mens alie·
nata: insania. Cp. the French, maison d'alie‘nls (lunatio asylum),

Engl. alienist, an expert on insanity. The figure in vis morbi is kept
up, Latin writers being rather partial to medical metaphors.

4. id adeo: this adverb often emphasizes a pronoun. So again l.
syo-more suo: ablat. of manner (ἓ 35). A mob is habitually unruly
and fickle and hence easily enticed into revolutionary schemes. This
aristocratic contempt ior the common people is shared by many Roman
writers.
