14. L. Cottam, etc: these had been elected to fill the vacancy
caused by the rejection of Autronius and Sulla, whose competitors and
accusers they had been. Sulla seems not to have been implicated in
this conspiracy; at least he was subsequently defended by Cicero and
acquitted of complicity.

15. fascibus: the seizure of the rods and axes was equivalent to the
assumption of supreme power, as th'ey symbolized consular authority.

1⁶. duas Hispanias: Hispania citerior and ulterior constituted two
of the most important provinces and hence their occupatiori was a
necessary strategic measure to insure the success of the revolutionists.
-Ea re cognita: Sallust's design to give but a brief account of
the first conspiracy has resulted in some obscurity‚ for if the plot was
divulged, it is not probable that an attempt at a massacre on an
even greater scale could have been seriously contemplated for the near
future. ,

17. transtulerant: Sallust is fond of the pluperlect (see note ch.

6, 17), though it may have been used here, because the postponement
antedated the subsequently mentioned actions.

18. sed with the omission of etiam, after non modo or non solum,
occurs with increasing frequency after Sallust's time-plerisque:
multis. Cp. note ch. 3. 13.

19. ni = nisi is archaic and colloquial, though not uncommon in
legal formulae and in poetry. It is very rare in Cicero and never used
by Caesar. See ch. 7, 18.

aoss maturasset. . . patratum foret (=esset): contrary-to-fact
condition in past time (569, 70).-pro curia=anre curiam. Itis
the Curia Hostilia or regular meeting·place of the Senate. After
being enlarged by Sulla it bumed down in 52 a. e.‚ but was rebuilt
by Caesar-post . . . Romam is to be taken with pessumum: he
would have perpetrated a dead, tlte most atracinus since, etc.

21. conditam: the most unusual position before urbem in this fixed
phrase and the addition of Romam materially heighten the effect of the
statement. Cp. note ch. 18, 4.—0n the use of the perfect pass. partic.
for an abstract noun, see note ch. 1, 15.

23. ea res: i. e. the premature signal. This account differs radi·
cally froma later one, according to which Crassus and Julius Caesar were
the leaders in this conspiracy. It had been arranged, that Caesar, by
allowing his toga to slip from his shoulder, should give the sign to Cras-
sus for carrying out their murderous plan, but the latter failed to ap-
pear at the critical moment and thus frustrated the design. The story
was probably invented by Caesar's enemies to show that his own assas·
sination by a very similar plot was in the nature of a retribution.
