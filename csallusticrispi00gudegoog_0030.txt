commentary, the following may here suffice by way ol

tempus; 9, 6, supplicia, ‘ceremonies '; 17, 6, necessitudo

Under this category also fall the numerous instances
of alliterution. This device is highly characteristic ol all
archaic and colloquial language, but with the exception
ol Sallust and Tacitus it is very rarely consciously em-
ployed in Latin prose. , Cp. 1, 11; 2, 22; 7, 15, facinora
fecere (esp. frequent), 11, 133 14, 2; 19, 3; 31, 2; 51, 123
58, 28.

3. Variety.—The third noteworthy feature ol Sallust’s
style, though it is not yet so conspicuous in the Cutiliae
as in his later works, is his fondness for syntactical varia·

added toan ablat. absol.; an oblique case varies with a
prepositional phrase; an historical infinitive is followed by
its equivalent, the imperfect; an adjective is combined
with an ablative phrase; an accusative with infinitive is

joined to a quod clause, and so similarly ulii . . . pars,
quod . . . quio, quo . . . nti. A bold example is fur-

pacem malebant, where pro takes the place of the com-
parative particle after malebant.

4. Syntux.—Sallust’s syntactical usage is fairly free
from bold innovations, though it differs in many respects
from that of Caesar or Ciccr0, his divergences being chief-
ly in the direction of greater freedom and a less rigid
uniformity. Thus the neut. adj, both in the sing. and
the plural, is used as a noun lar more frequently than in
previous writers. He has a special fondness for the
historical infinitive, and shows a marked preference for
the pluperlect, and lor the indicative in indirect discourse.
Strict sequence ol tense is at times relaxed, and the em-
