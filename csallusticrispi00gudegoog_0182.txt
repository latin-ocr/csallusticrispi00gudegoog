128 NOTES

118. obstabat: on the subjunct. with quominus aiter verbs ol
hindering.

119. tela militaria: such as the spear (uerum in the Samnite
dialect) and the shield (scutum).-The attributive is added merely to
contrast with magistratuum, the military and civil features ol Roman
lile.

120. insignia . . . ab Tuscis: such as the twelve lictors, the
curule chair, and the toga praetexta (purple border). Much in the
way ο1 religious ritual and the modes ol divination were also borrowed
irom the considerably older Etruscan civilization.

123. imitari sc. bonos, the object being reserved lor the second
clause. Cp. note ch. 36, 19.

124. Graeciae morem inritati, etc: the Romans generally be-
lieved that the decemviral commission sent to Greece in 451 Β. c. had

also intentionally confined to Caesar's speech.

129. lex Porcia, see above l. 75.-leges . . . quibus legibus:
this repetition ol the antecedent noun with the relative occurs repeat-
edly in Caesar, but as this is the only characteristic feature ol his style
in the entire speech, we must suppose that Sallust here merely imitated
the prolixity ol legal documents, being doubtless unaware oi the styl-
istic coincidence.

131. quo minus with subjunct. aiter the idea oi hindering implied
m causam.

133. illis . . . in nobis: 101 the sake oi variety-luit: on the
singul. verb with two abstract subjects, see note ch. 3, 21.

(h) ll.136-142: Caesar’s resolution.

136. eos . . . exercitum: chiasmus.

138. ipsos, etc.: according to Cicero, Caesar also imposed severe
