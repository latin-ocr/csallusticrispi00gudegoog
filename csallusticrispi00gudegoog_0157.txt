NOTES 103

18. si . . . soret: the protasis oi a conditional clause. the apodosis
(fore) being suppressed. The subjunct. is due to the indirect discourss
implied in sperabat. They'thought: si . . . fuerimus (lut. peri.)
.. .talia erunt-The sing. with quisque, especially in view oi the
plurals preceding, is noteworthy, although Sallust follows no consistent

rule. Cp. ch. 38,13.-As the bloody proscriptions oi Marius and Sulla
had greatly diminished the membership oi the senate, Sulla filled the

vacancies with his iaithiul iollowers, irrespective ol their birth or station.
Similar political advancement was now hoped ior by those who in times
ol peace could never have realized such ambitions.

19. iuventus: this is the third class spoken oi by Cicero. Enriched
by Sulla and colonized in Etruria, they had again become impoverished
by reckless extravagance aud were now compelled to eke out their ex-
istence as ianm-hands¹

2ο. largitionibus: These consisted in largesses of corn, in its sale
at greatly reduced rates, or in public leasts and entertainments. Can-
didates lor office frequently resorted to these practices to gain votes,
although this was in violation oi the law, as only the aediles were au·

25. quorum, etc. = ii quorum parentes.

26. proscripti . . . erepta sc. erant. The property oi those who
had been marked out lor assassination was confiscated and their de-
scendants were disiranchised. This latter law was finally repealed by
Caesar in 49 u. e., though an attempt to do so was made in the very
year oi the conspiracy (63), but it was irustrated by Cicero on the ground,
that ii the children oi the proscribed were now to attain to office, they
would convulse the commonwealth by retaliatory measureS.

27. animo: abl. oi manner (ἓ 35). ’

28. aliarum atque: other than, so regularly in classic Latin alter
words oi lilreness or &herenee-partium: possessive genit. (ἓ 22).
—malebant here takes both an acc. with infinit. and the nom. and
infinit, lor the pronoun ipse, by a peculiar idiom, is preferably re-
tained asanominative. Here the variation (rem publicam . . . ipsi)
subserves the.further purpose ol strongly contrasting the person and
