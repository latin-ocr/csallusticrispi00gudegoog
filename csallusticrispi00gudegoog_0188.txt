134 NOTES

84. hostibus: dative or ablative-laciniis: ,subjunctive oi in· ,

direct question, representing a deliberative in oratio recta (ἓ 52, 76).
—censeo, ironical, as credo above (l. 44) and scilicet, videlicet below (ll.
88, 101).—deliquere: this intentionally mild expression, and the
addition oi adulescentes (lor their youth might be alleged in excuse ,
ior their conduct) heighten the irony which pervades the entire para-
graph.

85. dimittatis: this is said in derision, leniency toward the pris-
oners being regarded by the speaker as tantamount to an unconditional
release.

86. ne . . . convortat: optative subjunct. (g 67).—mansuetudi·
nem . . . misericordiam: ironically repeated from l. 34.

87. ceperint: fut. perfect—miseriam: a punning reference to
misericordiam.

89. immo, etc: on the contrary, you arc really very badly scared.

9ο. alius alium is as usual construed with a plural verb. The one
lacking to one, the other to another.

91. dis: dative oi person with confido (ἓ 16).

93. auxilia: the continuans aid, the abstract plural, as often, de-
noting a number ol concrete instances or acts.

94. vigilando, etc.: Cp. the saying: God hclps him who helps him·
serf-prospera :prospere is more emphatic.

95. ubi . . . tradideris . . . implores: subjunct. oi the indel-
inite second person singular in subordinate clauses.

96. irati, etc: sor they are. Adversative asyndeton.

97. A. Manlius Torquatus: The act here recorded is elsewhere
attributed to Titus Manlius Torquatus in the Latin War (340 s. c),
Aulus, being his father who gained his surname in the Gallie War ol
(361 Β. c.) by slaying an enemy and stripping him ol his chain (torques).
This confusion is shared by the Greek historian Dionysius, a younger
contemporary oi Sallust. Similar errors occur elsewhere. So in Taci-
tus' Germania, the manuscripts have Marcus ior Cnaeus Manlius-This
paternal severity was proverbially designated as Manliana imperia.
For another instance see ch. 39, 17 and cp. ch. 9, 11.

98. pugnaverat: indicative as giving the author's own explanation,
not the reasons ol the father.

99. atque: ond in consequence.

100. morte: ablative ol means-vos: but you.

101. statuatis: an indirect question implied in cunctamini.

103. parcite . . . Lentuli: This is an answer to Caesar who in
his genuine speech is said by later writers to have urged his plea ior
mercy to Lentulus on the very ground oi his high rank.
