NOTES

XXXVIII

1. Cn. Pompeio, etc: 70 a. c.

2. tribunicia potestas: Sulla had reduced the power of the tri·
bunes of the people to a minimum by prohibiting them from proposing
laws. by depriving them of the right to harangue the people and of the

privilege to compete for the higher cumle officeS, but above all by cur·
tailing their time-honored authority of vetoing any measures which they
did not favor. This last prerogative was restored to them in 75 u. c.‚
but the others not until the consulship of Pompey and Crassus, the meas-
ure being a bid for popularity and intended as a checlr upon the sena-
torial party. Sallust's description of the effect of this restitution,
though most virid, is yet couched in too general terms to admit of veri·
fication, particularly as our knowledge of the period from the death of

Sulla (78 Β. c.) to the outbreak of the conspiracy is but meager.
3. adulescentes: of the more important magistracies‚ the tribune·

ship alone called for no minimum age limit‚ hut it rarely preceded the
quaestorship‚ which at this time could not be held before the 3lst year.
-surnmam potestatem: the tribunes, while in office, were sacrosanct,
but had the right to arrest or even imprison a consul, and their veto
power virtually made them the arbiters of all legislation.

7. fieri: histor. infinit-Contra . . . magnitudine: the em-
phatic word order can here be retained in the translation.

8. senatus specIe: i. e. under pretense of supporting the constitu·
tional rights of the senate. The ablat. of manner is postpositive and
govems a genitive like causei or gratia-Note the adversative asynde-
ton, sed, ‘but in reality,' being omitted before pro.

9. paucis sc. verbis, abl. of means (ἓ 33).-ahsolvam: purpose
clause depending, as often, upon something to be supplied from the
context: ‘to state the truth briefly, let me say, whoever,‘ etc—post
illa tempora: i. e. after 7o B. c.

ιο. agitavere = ege're. Sallust is especially fond of using agito as
a strengthened form of ago. See Vocabulary.-nominibus: abl. of
manner (ἓ 35).

11. alii . . . pars: On this favorite variation of Sallust, see ch.
2, 2. These two clauses are in distributive apposition with quicumque,
which is resumed by quisque in the conclusion—defenderent: sub-
junct. in a conditional clause of comparison after sicuti (ἓ 72), this
latter as a substitute for quasi being peculiar to Sallust.

12. foret: subjunct. of purpose (ἕ 64).

14. iltisz the leaders of the populace-his: the senatorial party,
ille referring as usual to what is remote, fricto what is reaten-modes·
