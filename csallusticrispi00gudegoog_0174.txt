120 NOTES

4. itineribus: ablat. oi means (g 33).-opifices ... duces:
chiasmus.

⁶. duces multitudinum: political agitatum, like Clodius and
Milo, who at the head ol bands'oi the Roman rabble terrorized the
commonwealth at elections, and tried to influeuce legislatinn by intimi·
datiou. lt was in one ol these iactioual quarrels that Clodius was slain
by the followers of Milo. Our district bosscs with their political heuch·
men furnish the best modern analogue.

8. familiam=servitia here. —iectos . .. exercitatos: the
' former refers more particularly to the slaves, the latter to the liberti, who
owed their freedom chiefly to their long-tried loyalty.

14. paulo ante: Dec. 4. Although the conspirators had been de·
clared traitors‚ a presumably delayed trial aud. possible acquittal would
only have made matters worse. Cicero felt that summary punishment
was imperative, butas he did not care to take this step, though possessed
of the authority, he was anxious to have the express sanction ol the
senate lor it. In alter years he refers to this lact as exonerating him

from all respousibility in the matter. See below (l. 22).

lowed by the err-consuls, the praetor-elect, ex-praetors and so on. It
