130 NOTES

others that the genuine speech contained a high eulogy ol Cicero and
an unequivocal charge, that Caesar was himself implicated in the con-
spiracy. In the following oration there is not a trace oi the lormer and
but a single and rather veiled allusion to the latter. (3) The speech
exhibits not only a number oi striking coincidences with passages in
Greek authors, such as the historian Thucydides (sth cent. Β. e.) and
the orator Demosthenes (384-322 Β. a). but also repeats sentiments
brought out by Sallust in previous chapters oi this treatise.

(a.) ll. 5-21: T lu present discussion does not deal with tlte question of
tribules or the complaints os ellim, but isone involoing the very
existence ef the commonwealtlt. It, therefore, demands immediate
ond effectioeremedies. ¹

7. ipse mecum: iore has a strong tendency in Latin to be retained
in the nominative.

9. ,aris atque focis: a proverbial expression lor ‘home' and a ia·
vorite with Cicera, who uses it also in the speech above relerred to. Cp.
Marco Bozarris: ¹ Strike sor your altars and your fires, God and your
native land! For the collocation (a a b -l- b), see note ch. 20, 23.

10. cavere . . . consultare: the infinitive aiter moneo, instead oi
ut with subjunctive, is chiefly poetic usage-quid . . . statuamus:
subjunctive in an indirect deliberative question (ἓ 52, 76). The opening
ol this speech closely resembles that of the 3d Olynthiac oration oi
Demosthenes.

11. persequare . . . provideris. . . implores: subjunctive ol
indefinite second person singular (ἓ 48).

12. hoc serves as subject to both accedat and euenit, hence its ini-
tial, emphatic position. Note also that ubi toenitis subordinated to
the following, principal clause, whereas nisi provideris and its object,
ne accidat, are together subordinated to the two.

13. nihil fit reliqui: lor this genitive, see note ch. 5, 15.

14. victis: dative oi reference (ἓ 17).

15. vostras: belongs equally to all the preceding nouns. Trans·
late with the first.

16. pluris: genitive ol price (ᾗ 27).

17. amplexamini . . . expergiscimini: second pers plur. oi the
present indic. oi amplexor and present imperative ol expergiscor.

20. vectigalibus: here equivalent to peculatus, misappropriation
of public reoenues ethome, this meaning being called lor by the context.
——sociorum iniuriis, the most common being extortion on the part oi
rapacious governors oi provinces, the charge being called res repetundee.
