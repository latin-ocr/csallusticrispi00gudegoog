Nonus ’ 99

6. me dius Fidius sc. sic iuvet, a common oath (like ‘so help me,
God Γ), literally ‘god of faith.’-veram sc. essa—licet cognoscas:
subjunct. in substantive clause, without ut, developed from the Volitive
(i ⁶4)-

7. iniuriis contumeliisque: abl. of means or cause (ἓ 33, 34).—
fructu: abl. of separation with privatus—laboris industriaeque:
this common collocation of synonyms gives the idea of thoroughness.

8. statum, etc: a euphemistic allusion to his defeats for the con·
sulship, dignitas being an almost technical term for the incumbent of
one of the curule offices Catiline had already been praetor, and
thought himself entitled to the higher office, both because of his
previous record and on account of his noble birth. As a matter of
fact, the only fruit of his alleged diligence and labor asa magistrate
had beenan impeachment for extortion, but with characteristic im-
pudence he only regards his inability to uphold his official rank as
degrading.

9. publicam: the close proximity with privatus, which is here the
partic. of privo and not opposed, as usually, to publicus, constitutes an-
other mark of the slovenly style of this leuen—pro mea consuetu·
dine: it might seem strange that Catiline should venture to make so
reckless a misstatement to a man like Catulus, but this letter was
primarily intended fora wider publicity.

ιο. non quia . . . non possem: on the causal subjunct„ see note
ch.34,10‚non quo . . . sed-meis nominibus: a commercial phrase
like Engl. to charge a debt to one's name in a ledger. The abl. is that
of quality (ξ 38).

11. ex possessionibus: the ambiguity occasioned by the omis-
sion of meis and the use of solvere, in contrast with persolveret, is
doubtless intentional—et alienis nominibus sc. aes alienum. The
reference is to debts of others for which he stood surety. The insertion
of the parenthesis by et again betrays the poor stylist, particularly as

’ the past potential subjunctssfpersolveret) is thus still dependent upon

non quia. We expect: non quia . . . possessionibus et. . . persolvere
possemus.

13. homines. . . honore honestatos: the archaicetymologicaf
figure and the alliteration are noteworthy. The allusion is to homines
novi like Cicero and the consul-elect Murena, the other, Silanus, being
even of ple'eeian descent.

14. suspicione: causal ablat. (ἓ 34).-alienatttm: cast aside, as
if he we're an alien, a very strange use of the verb.

15. hoc nornine = hac causa, is frequent in the colloquial style of
letters,
