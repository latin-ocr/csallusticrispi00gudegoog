ex libris Sibyllinis: The origin ol this famous collection ol proph-
ecies and religious ceremonias is enveloped in legend. They are first
mentioned as having been brought to Rome in the time ol Tarquinius
Superbus. They were deposited in the Capitol and were in charge ol a
special commission (quindecim viri sacris faciundis). In times oi great
peril, with a view to learning the proper policy to be adopted, they were
consulted in pursuance of a special decree ol the senate. The original
documenta were doubtless lost during the Gallie conflagratiou (39013. e.)
and in the destruction ol the Capitol here mentioned, but new sets
purporting to contain the same secrets regarding the destiny of Rome
were repeatedly collected, and they continued to exercise the saun
powerlul influence in shaping public policy or religious observances as
ol old. The present prediction, like a similar one supporting the mon·
archical designs ol Caesar, was an unauthorized publication designed
lorpolitical effect. Represeutatives oi so illustrious a lamily as that
ol the Cornelii had very probably been members ol the aforesaid
commission, and thus with lree access to these secret books they
could allow certain alleged conteuts to lealr out among the credulous

’ populace.
