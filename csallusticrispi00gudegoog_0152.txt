98 NOTES

9. nequiverit: subjunct. in indir. discourse, the perfect being used
because mittit is regarded as a true present. ’

10. nonque: non eoquod, takes causal subjunct, when it introduces
a hypothetica] reason (ἓ 62).

11. uti . . . foret-neve . . . oreretur: clauses ol purpose
dw-

12. oreretur: this, not oriretur, seems to have been the accepted
spelling in Sallust's time. ’

14. nornine: abl. of cause, like iussu, rogatu (ἓ 34).-redditas
sc. essa—exemplum: this is the regular word for an exact copy, and
numerous peculiaritiesof style and usage not only confirm the documen-
tary character· of the letter, but they also show that their author was not
a man of any literary skill. Α few quotations excepted, this and the
short letter in ch. 44, 13 fi. are the only original documents to be found
in the extant works of Latin historians

1. L. Catilina Q. Catulo: The superscriptions of Latin letters,
though, like ourS, of a stereotyped form, vary according to the familiar-
ity existing between the correspondents. Usually S. D. (salutem dicit)
or S. P. D. (salutem plurimam dicit) follow the name of the ad·
dressee in the dative. The omission of the greeting implies special in-
timacy.

2. cognita is to be taken with fides, re being an abl. oi means.
Catulus had defended Catiline from the charge referred to in ch. 15, 2.
—grata . . . periculis: a more skilful writer, instead ol 'adding this
appositional clause, would have said eoque gratior mihi quo maiora sunt
pericula—fiduciam . . . tribuit for sidem facit seems not to occur
elsewhere and is probably colloquial.

4. defensionem, etc: an apology implies an accusation which Cati·
line does not anticipate from a friend, but a justification (satisfactionem)
was in place to enable Catulus to defend him against any alleged misin-
terpretation of his actions—novo consilio: i. e. the sudden resolve to
join Manlius in Etruria, instead of going into voluntary exile at Mas-
silia, for the writer takes it for granted that Catulus was familiar with
the contents of the letters sent to other err-consuls (ch. 34, 7).

5. de culpa, ‘afguilt,' lor culpae, is colloquial usage and it is from
this that the prepositional genitive in Romance languages as well as in
English is developed. Its use here is all the more awkward, because it is
itself dependent upon a prepositional phrase.
