NOTES

LlX

(c.) Ch. lix: Final preparatians sor the battle an both sides.

1. signa canere: the verb is probably here to be taken absolutely,
agna being the subject accusat, although Sallust also has the transitive
construction with signa as object.

3. remotis omnium equis, etc: Cp. the very similar passage in
Caes. B. G. 1 25, Caesar, primum suo, danae amnium ex conspectu re-
motis equis, ut aequato omnium periculo, spem fugae tolleret, cohortatus
suosproelium commisit-quo . . . esset: subjunctive ol purpose.

5. pedes, on seat-pro: in accordante raith.

6. inter governs both montis and aspera (sc¹ loca).

7. rupe: causal ablative with aspera.

8. reliquarum: i. e. twelve, lor each legion had ten cohorts, but
these reserves were much reduced owing to the reason given in the lol-
lowing. As the cohorts did not have the normal number, Catiline pre·
lerred to give the impression ol having eight ol them fairly up to the
standard rather than nine or more numerically lar below it.—signa used
by metonymy (part lor the whole) lor the cohort. It seems, however,
loosely employed here, as only the maniples, three ol which made up a
cohort, are known to have had standards, in which case there would
have been 36 signa, not 12. But as the battle-array in cohorts, instead
ol in maniples, was an innovation ol Marius, Sallust may have carelessly
transferred the symbol ol the one to the other.

9. evocatos: these were veterans who aiter their term ol service
had expired again enlisted in a cohort, usually with the rank ol acen-
turio, ol whom there were six. Doubtless many ol the old soldiers ol
Sulla were among these. They were distinct from the lectos.

10. armatum: in case he had arms.

12. quendam: this shows that Sallust did not mean P. Furius who
is casually mentioned in ch. 50, 18 and is said by Cicero (in Cat. III 6,
14) to have been ex eis colonisquos Faesulas L. Sulla deduxit-curare,
take charge, a military phrase, and generally used absolutely.

13. calonibus: these were the servants ol soldiers who in an emer·
gency took part in the battle-propter as a local preposition is very
rare-aquilam: after the relorms ol Marius the silver eagle was made
the exclusive standard ol the legion.

14. bello Cimbrico: at the battle ol Vercellae, 101 Β. e. Catiline
probably regarded this ancient symbol in the light ol a mascot or talis-
man. Itis also mentioned by Cicero, in Cat. 11. 6, 13 aquilam illam

argenteam. . . scirem esse praemissam. On the ablat. ol time, see 542.
