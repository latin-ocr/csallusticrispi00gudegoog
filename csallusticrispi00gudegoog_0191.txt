NOTES 137

15. constabat: Observe the force of the imperfect. ‘I gradually
became convinccd,' and note the effective word order.

16. eoque factum, etc. : With reference to the historical facts just
stated (11. 10 ff).

17. superaret: subjunct. of result.

18. respublica: this assertion resembles that put into the mouth
of Cato (ch. 52, 28 f.).

19. magnitudine: causat ablative (ἓ 34).

20. effeta . . . petentum: the ancestral viriliry having become
exhausted. A very similar metaphor is found in the great Latin poet,
Lucretius (d. 54 B. e.).

21. multis tempestatibus: for a long tima On this meaning of
the noun, see note ch. 17, 20.

22. haud sane . . . magnus fuit: Sallust ignores Cicero probably
iu the not unjust conviction that in him the achievements of the orator
far surpassed those of the statesman. The exclusion of Pompey, how·
ever, is significant, if for no other reason than that he had received the
surname Magnus. Sulla does not fall within the time referred to, for
he died when the historian was but six years of age-ntemorie: ablat.
of time within which (ξ 42).

23. virtute . . . moribus: ablat. of quality (ξ 38). Note the ad-
versative asyndeton, sed being understood before divorsis.

24. obtulerat . . . fuit: the tense, on the analogy of the episto-
lary style, is due to the author's putting himself in the place of the
reader.

25. quin . . . aperirem: the quin subjunct. after non fuit con-
silium represents a peculiar type not yet recognized in the grammars

(b.) Ch. liv: Comparison between caesar and Cato.

This celebrated parallel is based upon the completed careers of both
men. The picture of Caesar, while drawn by one who remained loyal
to his benefactor and patron, is fair and moderate, though it hardly
does justice to the consummate and versatile genius of one of history's
greatest men. That of Cato, his life-long opponent, on the other hand,
is skilfully confined to· his moral and civic virtues, his suicide at Utica

having enveloped him for all subsequent generations in a halo of glory ,

out of all proportion to his actual achievements and his mediocre capaci-
ties as a statesman. We must be careful, however, not to fall into the
error of supposing that a characteristic quality predicated of the one
necessarily implies its non-existence or the existence of its opposite in
the other. The difference is often one of degree rather than of kind,
