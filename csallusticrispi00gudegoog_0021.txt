line. For a first essay in historical composition the
choice ol the subject was certainly a happy one. It dealt
with an episode of unquestionable significance, though
of very short duration. He had himself been an eye·
witness oi all the events to be described; he was old
enough to follow all movements with intelligence, and lit-
erary documents‚ such as Cicero’s speeches and other
sources, more or less authentic, were also at his disposal.
Finally, the story afforded a welcome opportunity for
illustrating his latter-day convictions regarding the grad·
ual downlall oi the ancient virtues and the disintegration
of those forces that had made Rome the mistress of the
world.

The second monograph, the Bellum Iugurthinum, is ·
thrown upon a larger canvas, and more numerous fig-
ures are introduced upon the historical stage, oi whom
tw0, Marius and Sulla, were destined soon to play
a most conspicuous part in shaping the destinies oi the
Republic.

It will thus be seen that Sallust had here attempted a '
more difficult task, and his success in carrying it out is
convincing evidence of his growing powers as a historian
and an artist, for the Catiline still exhibits certain ele-
ments oi immaturity irom which a first attempt is seldom
wholly free.

It is, however, not upon these two extant treatises that
Sallust's abiding reputation in antiquity was based, but
rather upon his latest and iar more voluminous work, en-
titled Historias in five books. lt comprised a very com-
plete narrative oi the critical period between the death oi
Sulla (78 Β. e.) and Pompey's rise to power (67 B. c).
Uniortunately‚ only two letters and four speeches, to-
gether with a few fragments, oi this his maturest produc-
tion have survived, and it is well to keep this fact in mind
if we desire to do lull justice to Sallust as a historian.
