ing the period immediately subsequent to the expulsiones the lrings (509
s. c.) pointing rather in the opposite direction.
7. incesserat: sc. in omnes-iuventus is generally used of the

youth capable of bearing arms, the following clause was, therefore,
not strictly necessary—simul ac = ubi primum-belli: genitive
with patiens.

10. habebant: note the plural after the collective noun, though the
sing. had been used twice before (erat, discebat). Such changes are
not uncommon. Cp. e. g. cb. 17, 17 ff. ς 23, 18 fi.

11. non: no, to preserve the emphatic anaphora (repetition).-ullus:
of any kind.

13. virtus : This clause stands in causal relation with the preceding.
So again ch. 43, 24, maxumam—gloriae: objective genit. (ξ 23).

14. se: the accur. with infinit. though the subject is the same as
that oi the governing verb. See note ch. 1, 1.—hostem ferire: col-
loquial for occidere hostem.

15. faceret : subjunctos desire with dum (ἓ 74).—facinus faceret:
a favorite collocation in Sallust. It is the so-called etymological figure,
like to do a daed. die a death, dream a dream.

16. bonam famam: the attributive was not necessary (see note ch.
3, 21), but bonam was added to balance with magnam following. Cp.
note ch. 1, 14.

17. putabant because of the plural idea in quisque, though faceret,
properabat had just preceded. See note above (1. 10). With the verb
supply esse f‘ constituted) as the predicate ol eas . . . eom, by attraction
forro. Cp. ch. 51, 501111ἓό.

laudis: the genitive with avidus is the regular construction and this,
owing to the antithesis, has naturally led to the use of the the same case
with liberalis. The genitive with adj. is of wider application in Sallust
than in previous writers

19. memorare, etc: cp. ch. 53,1o f.-It is said that the distin-

guished scholar L. Ateius Philologus compiled a summary of all the im· ,

portant events in Roman history expressly for the use of Sallust, his in-
timate friend-possem . . . ni traheret: possem is an optative sub·
junctive with utinam omitted, the perfect subjunct. of the indir. questions
depends on memorare and the apodosis to the contrary-talam condition
must be supplied (et memorarem).

21. naturi: naturally—pugnando = oppugnando. The use of the
simple verb for the compound begins to be frequent with Sallust-Itis
not known what particular instances are alluded to.

22. longius: too far.
