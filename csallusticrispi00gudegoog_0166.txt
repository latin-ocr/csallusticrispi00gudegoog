112 NOTES

rather to the name than to the character oi the writer, lor the letter was
anonymous. But ina brief note, composed in haste and under excite·
ment, such nice distinctions would have been overlooked even by a more
practised writer.

13. sim. . . sis . . . postulent: subjunct. in indirect questions
(ξ 76).-iae cogites . . . memineris is a colloquial substitute lor the
simple imperative, given in the Ciceronian version. These subjunct. are
followed by two jussive subjunct. in the rather less common second per-
son, which Cicero avoided (see above). All this strongly confirms Sal·
lust’s statement that he quotes the genuine original.

1⁶. ab insumis: cp. note ch. 39, 21.

17. mandata verbis: oral instructione-iudicatus sit: causat
subjunct. (5 62).

18. quo consilio: on what ground. Ablat. oi manner (ξ 35).-
repudiet: subjunct. in indirect question-parata esse . . . iusserit:
the infinit. and the perfect subjunct. in the relative clause are due to
the indirect discourse, the historieal present being taken as a primary
tense.

19. ne . . . cuncteturt jussive subjunct. (5 50).

XLV

1. rebus actis . . . constituta noete: temporal ablat. absol and
ablat. oi time, the difference being marked by the word orden-profi·
cisterentur: relative clause oi purpose (ξ 64).-per legatos: i. e.
indirectly through the medium ol Fabius Sanga. Cp. ch. 41, 6 ft.

2. cuncte: the accus. oi the thing is retained in the passive oi dou-
ble aecus. constructions (5 12).

3. C. Pomptino: by a curious coincidence, it was this very man
who only two years later (61 Β. c.) crushed the insurrection oi the Allo-
broges. Subsequently, in 51 Β. 0., he was one ol Cicero's trusted lieu-
tenants in Cilicia. ’

4. ponte Mulvio: over this famous bridge (now ponte Molle) the
via Flaminia, the great thoroughfare to the North, crosses the Tiber.

5. comitatus: i. e. the Allobroges and all those who accompanied
them, hence the plural abstract, which is very rare with this word, unless
it relers to different occasione.
⁸ ⁶. uti . . . sit: as the occasion demanded. Subiunctbyattraction.
-ita agant: subjunct. in substant. clause developed from the Volitive,
aiter permittit. Without ut, as often with verbs oi commanding (cp.
note 29, 7), but here particularly, because an ut had preceded. In di-
rect discourse we should have had ajussive subjunct. (ita agatis. . .
