32. ruina restinguam: Cicero's citation brings out the meaning ol
the metaphor more clearly: siquod esset in suas fortunas incendium
excitatum, id se nan aqua sed ruina restincturum, i. e. he would not put
out the fire with water in order to save what was possible. but he would
stop the conflagration lrom spreading by demolishing the dwellings oi
the rich that lay in its path, a covert allusion to the real objects oi the
conspiracy.

XXXII

(13.) Ch. xxxii: Catiline sets aut for the camp af Manlius.

The final instructions which the departing leader is here said to have
imarted seem strangely misplaced, inasmuch as they had all been pre-
viously known to Cicero and communicated by him to the senate in his
first speech with all the requisite details. Sallust, as repeatedly pointed
out, sacrifices chronological accuracy to the dramatic setting oi his
story. He may well, therefore, have preferred to insert these instruc·
tions at that point in his narrative when energetic official measures were
about to be taken to crush the conspiracy, in order to show with how

critical a situation the government was confronted.
1. curia: here used in the general sense ol senate chamber, ior the

senate on this occasion did not meet in the Curia Hostilia (cp. note ch.
18, 20), having been suddenly summoned to the temple oi Iupiter Stator,
as we learn from Cicero and others.

2. multu, etc: repeatedly turning over in bis mind tlte fact enat,
etc—quod . . . profectus est: the logical sequence oi the thought
is here somewhat confused. We expect volvens (=valvit) qnod in·
sidiae . . . nanpreeederent et ab incendio urbs. . . muniretur, aptu-
mumque . . . credens, etc, profectus est. Instead, a finite verb (intel-
legebat) is inserted and joined by et to a quad clause, depending upon a
participle (volvens) an unparalleled combination. But apart from this,
intellegebat is quite superfluous, ior ab incendia, etc., merely states
another iact which his reflection had brought home to him-It is also
worthy oi notice that Catiline immediately below is made to urge the
execution oi the very measures whose iutility he is here said to have
recognized.

3. consuli: dative ol indirect object with the verbal noun insidiae.
-procedebantr we should expect the subjunct. as giving the result
oi Catiline’s reflection, but it is here given as the remark oi the author
under the influence oi intellegebat. See ἓ 87.

4. optumum (sc. esse) iactu: this inf. is the predicate, the two iol-
lowing (augere-antecapere) the subject accusat. aiter credens.
