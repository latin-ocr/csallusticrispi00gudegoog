INTRODUCTION ' xxiii

ployment of the genitive after adjectives and especially of
the infinitive after nouns and after verbs (in place of ut)
¹ is extended far beyond the limits which Caesar or Cicero
would have recognized as permissible. The singular or
plural is used promiscuously after collective nouns, a
neuter plural pronoun preferably follows two feminine
substantives‚ quippe qui takes the indicative, but its equiv-
alent utpote qui, the regular subjunctive; the indicative is
found after sunt qui, and a verb of saying is very often
omitted and must be supplied from the context. Finally,
the ablative with intentus and the impersonal construction
with pro certo creditur are apparently peculiar to Sallust.
