absolute monarchy. The allusion here is to the socalled regal period,
from Romulus to Tarquinius Superbus (754-509 Β. 0,). Though largely
mythical, the story ol the seven kings oi Rome was, until modern times,
always regarded as authentic history.

22. quibus: dative ol possession with erat (ἓ uqi-annis .. .
sapientia. . . aetate . . . similitudine: musal ablat-Note the care-
tul halancing ol the two contrasted clauses (nominat. ÷ ablat. ·l· predic.
adject.).-The members oi the senate were selected, not ior the reasons
here given, but because they were· the heads oi iamilies orciuos, hence
their original name patres. Sallust was influenced by the later term,

23. consultabant = consulebant with dative, (reipublicae), seems to
occur only here.

25. conservandae . . . rei publicae: the predicative genitive in
gerundive construction denoting purpose is rare (ἓ 83). Tr. had aimed

last Roman king.

28. binos, not duos, because two were elected at a time-impers-
tores: magistrates who possessed the lull imperium or authority in peace
and war. Sallust avoids the original title praetores (on which see note
ch. 59, 24), because the term was in his time applied to an office whose
iunctions were chiefly judicial ; consul, on the other hand, was a term oi
a somewhat later date than the one here referred to.

3ο. licentiam, virtually equivalent to dominatio, as contrasted with
imperinm legitnmum.
