NOTES

’ v111

1. Sed profecto, etc.: but, to be sure refers back directly to Sed
gloriae . . . volebant, the intervening paragraph (memorare, etc.)being

a kind of parenthesis which a modern writer would have put into a foot-
note.-Fortuna, etc.: the conception of Fortune asan omnipotent but ,
capricious goddess is characteristically Roman. Sulla and Caesar each
regarded himself as her special favorite.

4. ego: observe how constantly Sallust by the use of this pronoun
forces his originality of view upon the reader’s attention. Cp. note ch.

4, Ῑ52.1 aliquanto: ablat. of degree of difference.

6. provenere: the figure is taken from plant growth. Here almost
equivalent to blossomed forth—ibi: Athens—scriptorum magna in·
genie. = scriptores magnis ingeniis, the plural of ingenium being fre-
quently used of the person. Barring rhetorical eulogies, such as the Pan-

athenaicus and Panegyricus of the orator Isocrates (d. 338 u. e.) and
possibly the history of Herodotus, there are but few great writers known
to us who can properly be classed among panegyrists of Athens. The
statement seems intentionally exaggerated, in order to emphasize the
contrast that, while the deeds of the Roman people in reality far sur-
' passed those of the Athenians, Rome was unfortunate in not possessing
patriotic historians to perpetuate the memory ol her prowess.

8. ita . . . ingenia: this implies that in Sallust's view the Athe-
nian historians followed exactly the opposite course from that demanded
in ch. 3, 7, in that the factu did not justify the brilliant style in which
they were presented.

10. populo: dative of possession with suit (ἓ rol-ea copia: l. e.
historians, such as Herodotus, Thucydides (5th cent. Β. e.), Ephorus,
Theopompus, and Timaeus (4th cent. Β. c.). The statement agrees with
that of Cicer0, who had said only a few years before Sallust began
to write, that ‘ History has found no place in Roman literature,' but
it contradicts Sallust's own assertion (ch. 3, 3 f.) and particularly that of
Livy, who in his Preface expresses the fear that his own fame might be
eclipsed by the many great historians of Rome who preceded him.

11. negotiosus: The same excuse is frequently met with, for the
Romans keenly felt the superiority of the Greeks in literature, art, and
science, and hence they proclaimed it to be their peculiar mission ‘to
rule the world by equitable lawe, to spare the conquered and to crush
the proud' (Virgil). Cp. also ch. 53, 13.—ab aliis: this seems to
contradict what had just been asserted, unless we assume that Sallust
did not look upon the alii as men of genius; and it is true that, if we
