slaln his enemy. The last clause, however, leaves no doubt as to what
the author's real conviction was,

16. satis dictum sc. est, in accordance with his promise, quam bre-
vissumc potero (ch. 18, 2 h).

(1.) Ch. xx: Catiline’s speech to his sollcwcrs, describing their sorry
pliglct, the remedy and rewards.

Such speeches are a characteristic feature ol classical historiography.
They are usually wholly fictitious, but even where a speech was known
to have been delivered, as in the case ol Caesar and ol Cato (ch. 51.
52), it is invariably composed in the author’s own style, who aims, how-
* ever, to put only such sentiments into the mouth oi the speaker as
were suitable to the occasion and in conformity with his character. In
this universal method, no deception was practised or involved, as is
shown both by the uniformity ol the style and the introductory formulae

(e. g. huiusce moda).
1. quos . . . convenisse: refers back to ch. 17, 7, eo convenere, etc.

a. multe . . . egeret: see Vocab.
3. iore . . . adpellare. . . cohortari: the first inl. is the object

ol credens, the others the subject ol fore, univorsos their object.
4. secedit . . . habuit: Sallust not inlrequently changes from the

histor. present to the perfect.
5. arbitris: derived from ad and an obsolete verb bito, ‘to g0,'

hence an outsider, lrom which the more common meaning, witness, um-
pire, as a third party, easily developed.—0rationem: lrom a speech
ol Cicero’s (pro Murena) it appears, that sentiments similar to those lol-
lowing were uttered by Catiline at a meeting called in the next year.
Ii so, then Sallust merely placed the speech at this stage ol the narrative
lor dramatic effect, chronological considerations having generally little
weight with him.

7. spectata: neut. plur. alter two fem. nouus. Cp. note ch. 10, 9.
On the contrary-to-lact condition, see ἓ 70, the pluperl. (cecidisset, fuis-
sent) being here used, because Catiline chooses to regard the enterprise as
already accomplished.-mihi: the dative ol the agent altera passive, lor
a mc, is rare in earlier writers (ἕ 18).

8. opportuna = opportuna—cecidisset: though Sis lond ol the
simple verb lor the compound, accidisset was here avoided because it is
generally used ol something unlavorable.
