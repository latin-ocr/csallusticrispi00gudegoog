NOTES 119

the very word applied to Caesar by Catulus, is exaggerated, for Caesar
was at the time 37, while his competitor had not yet reached senectus
which with the Romans began at the age of sixty. But designations of
the time of life are very loosely employed in Latin generally.

9. maxumis honoribus: he had been consul in 78, censor in 65
n. c. and was at the time the leader oi the senate. It was he also who
had rebuilt and consecrated the Capitoline temple of Iupiter in 69 s. e.

ιο. victus discesserat: this seems to have been the regular ex-
pression for a politieal defeat, as it also occurs in the poet Lucretius, a
contemporary of Sallust.

11. privatim. . . publice: to be taken with the two ablat. of
cause, the adverbs referring somewhat boldly to the verbal idea im-
plied in the substantives. Caesar's extravagance as a private citizen re-
sulted in an indebtedness of 81,500,000, and as aedile, he conducted the
public garnes on a most lavish scale, this being, indeed, a time-honored
practise in courting popularity.

12. grandem pecuniam debebat: Sallust has in this apologetic
paragraph doubtless intentionally avoided his usual phrase, alienum aes
grande conflaverat (ch. 14, 7; 24, 12).

15. quaese. . . audisse . . . dicerent for quae audissent ue
dicebant, the verb of saying being not infrequently in relative clauses put
into the subjunct., where the subjunct. of the verb in the infinit. (audisse) ·
with a parenthetical clause is expected. In the present case the sub·
junct. is due to the indirect discourse implied in ementiundo.

τό. illi: i. e. Caesar.
ao. egredienti: i. e. from the meeting of the senate (Dec. 5) in

which he delivered the speech reported in ch. 51·
nt. minitarentur: subjunct. of result after usque ea ut (ἓ 66).

L
(9.) Ch. l,1-10: Attempt to rescue Lentulus and Cethegus.

1. Dum baec . . . geruntur takes up the thread of the narrative
interrupted at ch. 48, 33. For the dum construction, see ἓ 55.

3. praemis: we do not know what they consisted in, but the spe-
cific grievances of the Allobroges were ignored, and in consequence they
rebelled in the following year. See note ch. 45, 3.-liberti: former
slaves whom he had freed and who remained in the master's household
(familia). They are called libertini in reference to their social rela-

tion, as distinguished from those born free (ingenue).-clientibus: fol·
lowers who were in some condition of dependency upon a patron and
looked to him for support and protection.
