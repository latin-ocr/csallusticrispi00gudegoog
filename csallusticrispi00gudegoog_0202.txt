148 NOTES

19. amicum. . . hospitem: effective chiasmus.

21. cognoscerent: the subjunctive oi characteristic aiter sunt qui
(5⁶³)-

laetitia, maeror, luctus atque gaudia: For the collocation so
characteristic of Sallust, here in chiastic order (a b: b÷ a), see note,
ch. 20, 23. The first pair denotes merely these emotions as such, the
second their outward manifestations, hence also the plural (‘ outbursts

oi grief and joy ’).
