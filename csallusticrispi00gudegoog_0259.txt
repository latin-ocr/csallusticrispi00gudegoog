TWENTIETH OENTURY TEXT-BOOKS.

Caesar's Commentaries.

By Jonw H. Wusrcmr, Ph.D., Professor os
Latin and Tutor in Roman Law, Princcton Uni-
versity. Edition ol seven books 5125. Edition “
of four bookS, Suro.

In the introduction to this volume the editor presents
the character of Caesar to the student not merely as the
conqueror of Gaul and the author ol the Commentaries,
but as a real human being-one ol the most powerful
factors in the history of the world. Two editions will be
issued: one containing the whole of the seven books; the
other the first· four books only, omitting text and notes of ¹
Books V, VI, and VII, leaving the introduction and
vocabulary the same. The vocabularyis brief and eom-
pact, without such scientific and philological matter as
would be beyond the grasp of the average high-school
pupil. The text is fully and appropriately illustrated, not·
ably in regard to the account of Caesar's army, its organi·
zation, tactics, military engineering, etc. The notes to
Books I and ΙΙ are unusually full and comprehensive, con·
taining many grammar references3 the notes to the last
books are brieter, directed mainly to following the narrative
and allowing more rapid reading ol the text. A bibliog-
raphy is given, suggesting the best books for the teacher's
collateral reading or study.
