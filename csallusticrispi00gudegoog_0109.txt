17. auxilio: ablat. oi separation with egere occurs in but two other
places in Sallust. Elsewhere he uses the genit. (ὅ 30).

Il

1. igitur is in Sallust and some later writers, like Tacitus, contrary
to the usage ol Cicero and Caesar, preferably placed at the beginning ol
the sentence-initio: ablat. ol time-This vague statement refers to
the so-called Golden Age ol innocence and virtue, which the ancients
londly imagined had preceded their own more degenerate times. As a
matter oi fact, kingly rule is a relatively late phase in the development
oi human society-in terris: as both Greeks and Romans invariably
pictured their gods as living under amonarchical government, this appar-
ently insignificant addition reveals the radical attitude oi the historian,
who unquestionably regarded the conception ol a divine monarchy as
nothing more than a reflex oi human conditions and therefore oi later
date-nomen, etc: monarchy was the first name given to sovereign
power.

2. id: i. e. regnum, to be supplied out ol reges, the pronoun being
attracted to nomem-pars . . . alii, lor the sale oi variety, instead oi
alii. . . alii, orpars . . . pars. The two clauses are in apposition to
divorsi,

3. cupiditate: this quality is here singled out because Sallust regarded
it, including, as it does, both avarice and ambition, as primarily respon-
sible ior the degeneracy of his own times. Cp. ch. 10, 8 ἧς 53, 23 il.

4. postea . . . quam is in S. always separated by one or more in-
tervening words ; postquam more rarely. ,

6. coepere precedes, partly because it governs not only subigere but
also habere and putare, partly in order to bring the subject and predicate
closely together. Thus in Graecia and in Asia have an emphatic posi·
tion. Cp. ch. 7, 1 ς 38, 4.-The shorter lorm ol the perfect is common
in all writers, except in Caesar and in Cicero, who avoided it entirely,
whereas Sallust uses the longer (erunt) but lour times.-nationes:
barbareus tribes, the usual meaning ol the word-Note the chiasmus,
for nationes relers to Cyrus urbis to the Lacedaemonians and Athe-
nians(a:b:b:b:::a).

7. dominandi: objective genit. (ἓ aab-maxumam . . . maxuma:
the repetition of the same adject. is a savorite device lor imparting
special emphasis toan idea.

8. tum demum: then and net until then.

9. plurimum: adverb. accusat, separated from posse to admit ol
the juxtapositionoi subj. and predicate. See note ch. 1, 14.
