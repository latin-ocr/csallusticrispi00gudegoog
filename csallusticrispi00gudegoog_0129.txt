NOTES 75

ol supplying a plural verb from a preceding sing. noun is common.—
Catilina: it is more than doubtful whether Catiline was evena party
to this plot. In any case he played a iar more subordinate rhle than is
here attributed to him.

3. L. Tullo, eto: 66 Β. c,

4. designati consules: the eniorced resignation oi consuls-elect
was a most unusual occurrence. hence designati is made to precede
consules, contrary to the fixed official designation. Cp. note ch. 14, 6.

5. legibus ambitus: The law against bribery at electioris here re·
lerred to was that oi Acilius Calpumius‚ passed in 67 Β. c, Its pro-
visions, in case ol conviction, included a money fine, exclusion from the
senate and the annulment oi the right to hold office. The consular
elections usually took place in July‚ the installation on Jan. 1.-legi·
bus: abl. ol manner (ἓ 35).—interrogati: interrogare is a technical
legal term designating the questions put to the defendant by the plain-
tifl or the judge in regard to the most important points ol the charge.
This was followed by the regular that—poenas dederant: i. e. they
were not allowed to be seated.

6. post paulo: very unusual lor paulo post-pecuniarum repe-
tundarum: a technical phrase lor extortion (lit. the demanding back ol
money secured by extortion), usually in the provinces. So in the case
ol Catiline‚ who was propraetor ol Africa in 66 Β. e.‚ his rapacity leading
to his impeachment. The vagueness ol post paulo makes it impossible
to determine whether Sallust meant that C. was a candidate ior one ol
the vacaneies just created or that he intended to stand ior the 'consul-
ship ol the year 65. The eodem tempore, as iar as it goes, seems to

imply the former, which would contradict the statement ol a later, very
trustworthy authority, that he had been a candidate for the first election

in 66, but had been compelled to withdraw because under charges,

7. prohibitus erat: This verb more frequently takes the infinit.
than quominus, quin or rra—intra legitimos dieS, etc. : A candidate
had to declare his intention belore the consul 17 days prior to the elec·
tion. In the present instance Catiline’s rejection seems to have been
based on the technical ground that his candidacy was illegal, it announced
while charges were pending against him, not because he had lailed to
register his name at the proper time. “

9. audaciae: gen. ol quality (ἓ 26).

12. Nonas Deo: Dec. 5. On that day the quaestors were inau-
gurated, Piso being one ol them.

13. Kalendis Januariis: Abl. ol time (5 42). They selected
New Year’s day, when the consuls-elect were accustomed to march in a
solemn procession to the Capitol, to take the oath oi office.
