porary Romans. In putting fictitious speeches into the
mouths of his dramatis personae, Sallust was merely iol-
lowing the time-honored and universal custom oi ancient
historians; and even ii we must needs admit that those
in the Cutiliae at times lack verisimilitude, it must not be
iorgotten that we are here dealing with a first attempt,
the speeches in the Historias and even those in the
Iugurtha, as already observed‚ showing the progress he
was destined to make. An indifference to chronological ,
precision and topographical accuracy is conspicuously in
evidence in the Catilina no less than in the Iugurtha.
We moderns may deprecate the fact that Sallust falls
short oi the scientific standards demanded today, but it
is more than doubtful whether the Roman historian would
have accepted thern as binding upon himseli had they
been known to him.

Instead of censuring an ancient historian ior alleged
blemishes, it is rather incumbent upon us to inquire first
ol all what his object was, and then to determine to what
extent he succeeded in realizing that object. Viewed in
this light, the Bellum Catilinae, in spite oi a certain imma-
turity oi execution, must ever occupy a high rank in
Roman historiography.

By his philosophical reflectione his keen analyses of
character and of the motives oi action, his retrospects oi
Roman society, albeit the good old times are unduly
idealized and the gloomy picture oi the present exagger-

cise perspective in which he desired to have the reader
view the story he was about to tell. By means oi speeches,
the thoughts and the ieelings by which he believed the
speakers had been actuated are brought out into promi-
nent relief. Primarily intent, as Sallust was, upon giving
¹to posterity a vivid‚ dramatic, and, so far as in him lay,

an impartial narrative, in an artistic and captivating
