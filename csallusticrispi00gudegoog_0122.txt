68 NOTES

duration, for it was soon after his victory followed by a bloody massacre
of the Marian party.
12. rapere: the infinitives are historical.-domus . . . agros:

chiasmus.
14. modurn. . . modestiam: alliterative collocation of synony-

mous terma-huc accedebat quod: a favorite phrase ol Sallust,
equivalent to ‘moreover, furthermore.’

16. ductaverat = duxerat. This preference for the frequentative
verb is in accordante with the archaic tendenciesof Sallust-Sulla fought
against Mithridates of Pontus, from 87-84 Β. e.-qtto with subjunct. of
purpose in a non·c0mparative clause, in place of ut, is an archaism
exceedingly frequent in Sallust.

22. rapere, etc. After the destruction of Syracuse in 212 Β. c and
especially aiter that of Corinth by Mummius in 146 Β. c., a veritable
mania for transporting Greek works of art to Rome had developed. A
notorious offender in this respect was Verres, the praetor in Sicily, whose
robberies are denounced by Cicero iu the fourth speech against Verres,
entitled de signis. By way of contrast it may be mentioned that Pompey
boasted that, while marching through Greece, he did not think it worth
while even to look at its art treasures.-delubra spoliare refers more
particularly to the masterpieces of sculpture and painting in Greek tem-

Italy, was undertaken by the emperor Nero (54-68 Α. D.).

note ch. 5, 15.

25. ne = nidum, ‘much less,' hence construed with the subjunct. is
a very rare and probably colloquial usage—conruptis moribus: either
causal abl. abs. (‘ in view of,’ etc.) or abl. of quality (ἓ 38). The latter

is referable.
ρ26. victoriae: dative with temperarent (ἓ 16).-As even wise men

are apt to lose their seli-restraint amid prosperity, itis not surprising
that the soldiers of Sulla, already demoralized, did not exhibit modera-
tion.

XII .

1. honori: dative with esse (g ao).

2. sequebatur: sing. pred. after abstract subjects (S 3).—hebe·
scere . . . haberi: obimus-paupertas: i. e. absence of wealth, the
proper word for poverty being egestas-probro: dat. with haberi (ἓ 20).
—innocentia . . . duci: those who did not look upon the acquisition
of wealth and power as the only legitimate pursuits of life were accused
of following more virtuous practices solely for the purpose of being able
