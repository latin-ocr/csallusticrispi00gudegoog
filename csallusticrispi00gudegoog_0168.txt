114 NOTES

and significance or because they were unknown to him. In either case,
by tersely stating that Cicero, regardless of his own possible peril, chose

the path of duty and patriotism, he pays a high compliment to his moral
courage and love ol country, such as we should not have expected from
an alleged enemy.

13. indicio: disclorure. i. e. the evidence which Cicero had secured
by the seizure of the letters and the presumable information fumished
by the ambassadors. Caeparius was captured soon after (ch. 47, 23 f.).

14. Consul . . . perducit: this was merely an act of grace which
Cicero felt was due to the high official rank of Lentulus. The others
were handed over to ordinary police officers.

ιδ. in aedem Concordiae: the temple of Concordia was located
at the foot of the Capitoline hill, facing the Forum, and was frequently
used as a meetingplace for the Senate. Near-by was the prison in which
the conspirators were executed. Nothing remains of this temple now
except a terrace-lilre foundation.

17. frequentia: ablat. of attendant circumstance (ἓ 36).

XLVII

2. consili: the partitive genitive belongs to quid, the displacement
being due toa desire to bring the interrogatives into juxtaposition.-
habuisset: indirect question after interrogatus.

3. fingere . . . dissimulare: histor. inlinit„

4. fide publica: ablat. of attendant circumstances (5 36).-This
was the technical term applied to the promise of immunity, in case a
witness turned State's evidence-omnia, as docetque, etc, seems to
show, is best taken as the subject of erant gesta, the reference being to
the details given iu ch. 44, 8-11.

6. amplius . . . legatos: he doubtless honestly believed that the
ambassadors knew no more than he did, for according to the very next
statement he was unaware of the detailed information (ch. 40, 25 f.) im·
parted to the Allobroges and his resistance also proves that he misinter-
preted their complacent surrender. The reason which Volturcius is
said to have given is, however, far from convincing.

7. audire (sc. se esse) solitum: it is not quite clear why Gabinius
repeatedly mentioned only three conspirators of little importatae, con-
cealing the names of many others (multos praeterea).

9. eadem: i. e. uti ornnia gesta erant.

11. sermonibus: ablat. of means.

¹3· portendi. . . esse . . . esse: accusat. with infinit. altera
verb of saying implied in sermonibus. Cp. note ch. 21, 9.
