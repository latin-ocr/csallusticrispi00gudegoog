110 NOTES

to suppose that Catiline with well-organized and combined forces would
be near enough to the city to take an active part in' case of an emer-
gency and to complete the victory. The contradiction with which Sal-
lust has been charged does not therefore exist Nor are the diflerences
between his account and that of Cicero irreconcilable. Cicero tells us
that the decisive blow was to have been struck on the Saturnalia (Dec.
17). If so, we must suppose that the original date had been changed
from some day after Dec. 10(cp. die's prolatando). The contio would
then have been fixed for Dec. 16, the incendiarism and assassination
following the very next night (proxima nocte). The postponement was
doubtless due to Lentulus's anxiety to insure the proximity of Catiline.
This would plausibly explain his urgent request in ch. 44, 19, made not·
withstanding Catiline's previous assurance(ch. 32, 12 f), and it would at
the same time satisfactorily account for the displeasure of Cethegus at
what he rightly felt was a fatal delay‚ for the capture of the Allobroges
frustrated all their well-laid pians-exercitu: the conspirators nat-
urally magnified the number of those who followed Catiline on his way
to Manlius

5. quereretur. . . imponeret. . . exsequeretur: subjunct. of

purpose after constituerant uti (ξ 64).
- ⁶. optumo consuli: the epithet conveys no personal compliment‚
but seems to have been frequently used like our modern official thies,
¹ His Excellency, the Right Honorable‚ his Honor,’ etc., Cicero himself
on one occasion, when so spoken of by Brutus, did not consider himself
praised.

7. signo: ablat. of means (ξ 33).

8. coniurationis: coniuratorum: abstract for concrete.

9. ea sc. negotia, as implied by the distributive quisque-divisa sc.
essa-Statilius et Gabinius: Cicero repeatedly mentions one L.
Cassius as having been delegated for this particular task‚ while Plutarch
(ad cent. A. D.) in his Life of Cicero speaks of one hundred men,
“ selected for as many districts. Where the original information was
necessarily so largely dependent upon hearsay and rumors‚ such dis·
crepancies were inevitable.

11. incenderent: this and the following subjunctives‚ with the ex-
ception of fieret (pure purpose) are substant. clauses developed from the
Volitive (ἓ 64).

13. parabantur. . . erat: the indicat. represents these state-
ments as belonging to the author.

15. familiarum ι the singular, familias or familiae, though usual with
the sing. and plur. of pater and mater, would have been ambiguous here.
-quorum‚ etc. : emphatic word order for q. ncaxima pars erat ex nob.
