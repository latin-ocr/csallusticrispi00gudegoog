” lama . . . fortunis: the abl. oi separation with expers, ior the more
usual genitive, is archaic and colloquial usage. lt does not occur else-
where in Sallust, but is not surprising in the uncouth style of a soldier.
10. more: in accordance with, etc. Ablat. oi manner (ἓ 35).-
lege uti, etc: the position oi these words restricts the allusion to the
laws of usury, such as those of the year 367 and 343 u. c. These may
well have been a dead letter at this time, so that the debtor, ii he wished
to avoid the consequences resulting from his insolvency‚ was completely
at the mercy ol ruthless creditors (saevitia faeneratorum).-amisso
patrimonio, etc.: their entire property did not suffice to cover their
debts It seems, however, to judge from laterenactments, that a debtor
could not at this time have been compelled to sacrifice his entire estate.
11. liberum corpus hahere: belore the Papirian law ol 325 or 312
nc, indebtedness having been duly established by the court, non-payment
might result in imprisonment ior two months. Ii the debt was not cau-
celled aiter that time, the creditor might sell the delinquent into slavery
or even slay him. The praetor possessed considerable latitude in the
interpretation ol the law, and an instance is recorded, where a decision
adverse to the creditors resulted in his murder. Still, even the saevitia

1 praetoris here mentioned cannot well have restored to a creditor the an·

cient privilege, and hence Manlius, intent, as he is, throughout upon
awalrening sympathy, very naturally pictured his plight in somewhat ex-
aggerated colors.

12. saepe, etc: several such laws (decreta) ior the alleviation oi
debtors or the poor are recorded. Thus the Licinian law oi 367 Β. e.
allowed the interest already paid to be deducted irorn the total debt, the
Flaminian ol 123 Β. c. reduced the price ol corn ior the people, the state
purchasing the supply at its market value.

13. vostrum: the partitive genit. plur. oi the pronoun here takes
the place ol the nom. plur. possessive (vestre). This usage. though ex·
pressly attested lor this passage by an ancient writer, may, in view of
ch. 51, 114, maiores nostri, have been intentionally employed in this let-
ter to give a colloquial touch to its style, it Sallust did not actually cull
it from the original. See note above (l. 5).-13. miseriti: nom. plur.
oi the partic. On the genit. with this verb see (ἓ aph—decretis:
abl. ol means (ἓ 33).—inopiae: dative with opitulati. This combina-
tion closely approaches the etymological figure (cp. note ch.7,15),
ior the verb is derived irom ops and tuli (the perlect oi ferre), hence
= opem ferre inopiae (⁶ corne to the help oi helplessness ¹). It occurs
nowhere else in Sallust.

14. novissume, etc. : by the Valerian law oi 86 Β. c, the copper as,
the smallest Roman coin (about ra), was temporarily made equal in value
