A Latin Grammar for Schools

By Annnaw Fannius Wusr, Ph.D., LL.D.,
Professor of Latin and Dean of the Graduate School,
Princeton University. ramo, Cloth, 90 cents net.

This book has been prepared lor schools and lor beginners
in Latin. It is limited to the things most essential for the young
pupil to know—the things he can grasp and use in reading his
school authors.

The airn has been to state only the essentials, to define thern
as simply as the facts warram, and to give as much explanation
as will lasten them firmly in the mind. This involves the rejec-
tion ol all unnecessary technical termS‚ unimportant exceptions,
lormal and pedantic modes ol expression, and all refinements ol
doctrine that properly enter only alter the school stage. As lar
as possible, everything has been put in a concrete way, that the
pupil may see in his grammar the satislying explanation ol living
usage, rather than the dissection ol a lileless material.

This grammar has kept strictly in view the developments in
the reaching ol Latin in our schools during the last ten years. lt
is planned to cany out lully the spirit ol the resolutions on the
subject adopted hythe National Educational Association on
recommendation ol the American Philological Association. The
author has taught Latin in both the Western high school and
the Eastern academy, as well as in the college. During his whole
career, his relations with secondary school worlr, particularly with

Ι the lormulation ol the program ol Latin studies recently adopted

by the National Educational Association, have been most intimate
and constructive.
