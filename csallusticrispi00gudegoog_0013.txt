PREFACE Ν J„

As the present work contains two features new to
secondary school editions, a brief word of justification
will not seem out of place.

It has been the general practice hitherto to give the
very numerous grammatical references called for in an
edition of this character at each and every passage in the
Commentary where some syntactical usage is discussed
or pointed out. This method not only involves a consid·
erable sacrifice of space, but it naturally acts as a deter-
rent upon the pupil, who is notoriously averse to the con-
stant looking up of grammatical references in any case.
Ι have, therefore, resorted to the expedient of relieving
the Notes of this burden by giving all references to stand-
ard grammars once for all under separate headings in the
Introduction, a single numeral in the Notes pointing to
the paragraph in the Introduction, where a pupil, if hehe
so minded, can find the desired information.

The second innovationis of greater pedagogical im-
portance, and will, Ι am confident, meet with the favor of
both teacher and pupil. Ι refer to the Special Vocabulary.
The only practical ‘raison d’etre’ for a separate Vocabu-
lary is, I take it, to facilitate the young student’s prepara-
tion by obviating the necessity of consulting a large Dic-
tionary. The current Vocabularies, however, so far as
they have come under my observation, do not seem to me
fully to subserve this supreme purpose, for not only do
they, precisely like the larger Dictionary, give an array

of possible renditions, from which a selection must be
