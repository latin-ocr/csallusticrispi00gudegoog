NOTES

XXVI

(7.) Ch. xxvi. Catiline, again repulsed at the polls, resolves upon war.

1. his rebus points back to chap. 24, 8, the intervening narrative
being disregarded as a mere digression

a. proxumum annum: i. e. ior the beginning oi 62 u. c., the elec·
tions usually taking place in July of the previous year. See note below,
1.1o.

3. si . . . foret . . . usurum scesse. In direct discourse: si . ..
ero, utar. ¹

6. dolus is a word ol neutral meaning (see note ch. 11, 7), hence
astutiae is added to detine it more closely-aut, or rather.

7. multa, etc. : perhaps a money reward and immunity from arrest.
Cp. ch. 23, 9.

8. Q Curius .. ‚sibi proderet: Sallust is here inconsistent,
for he implies that Cicero, who according to ch. 23, 16 fl. cannot be
included among the complures, had, on learning of Fulvia’s disclosure,
succeeded in extracting from her the name of the hitherto anonymous in-
former, and yet it is clear from ch. 28, ὁ ff. that Fulvia continued, as be-
fore, to act as the go-between. This agrees with the narrative in Plu-
tarch’s Life of Cicero in which Curio's name does not occur at all.

10. pactione . . . perpulerat: Gaul had fallen to the lot of An-
tonius and Macedonia to that of Cicero, but the latter handed over
the rich province to his impoverished colleague (see note ch. 21, 12),
Metellus Celer being sent to Gaul, as Cicero preferred to stay in
Rome. '

11. contra rem publicam sentiret : an idiomatic phrase meaning
‘to betray the commonwealth.'

13. dies comitiorum venit: owing to the rumors regarding a con·
spiracy the election had been postponed by a decree of the senate from
July to Oct. 28th.

14. petitio: Catiline's competitors were the famous lawyer Servius
Sulpicius, D. Iunius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena. The last two
were elected, Catiline receiving the lowest number of votes—insidiae,
etc. : this refers to the attempts at bribery and military intimidation at
the polis. Murena was accused by Sulpicius and Cato oi bribery,
under a severe law which had recently been passed by Cicero, but the
latter successfully defended the consul-elect in a speech which is still
extant and which gives a vivid picture of the stirring incidents preced-
ing and following the election.

17. aspera foedaque: this more emphatic use ol the predicate ad·
jective forthe adverb is much affected by Sallust.
