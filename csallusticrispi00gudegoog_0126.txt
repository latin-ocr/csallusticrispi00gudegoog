72 NOTES

-usu . . . inlecebris: abl. oi means (ς sah-similisque: Sallust
invariably uses the dative with this adj. (5 21, 28). ¹

17. etiam, still. So again ch. 61, 9.

19. praebere . . . merceri . . . parcere: historical infinit.
(S 8²)-

21. faceret: The subjunct. with dum expressing a wish (ᾖ 73).

22. existumarent, subj. in a clause of characteristic after fuisse

nonnullos (= erant qui). See ἓ (ia—ita need not be translated, as it
merely points to what follows,

23. frequentabat: an explanatory statement of the writer and
hence put in the indicative, as not being a part of the oratio obliqua
(S 87)-

24. ex aliis rebus: they are enumerated in ch. 15-16, Ine-magis
quam quod = non quod, hence cuiquam and not alicui.

25. compertum foret: the forms foret, etc. = esset are very rarely
found in prose before Sallust, who has a special liking for thern-The
subjunct. is used because the reason assigned is that of another than
the writer (ss 62).

XV

1. multa nefanda: contrary to the Latin idiom Sallust sometimes
omits the conjunction after multa, when joined to another attributive.

2. sacerdote Vestae : her name was Fabia and she was the sister·
in-law of Cicero, She was acquitted of the crime here mentioned, in 73
a. e., but as Sallust repeats the charge he seems to have thought her
guilty.

3. ius fasque: the first crime violated the human law of society,
the second was also an insult to the goddess ; hence sas is added.

⁶. illi: dative with nubere-dubitabat: when this verb means to
hesitate, it usually takes the infinitive (ἓ 76).

7. aetate: ablat. of specification (ἓ 39).—creditur . . . fecisse:
as captus shows, the writer intended to use the personal construction .
with creditur, but substituted the impersonal bythe addition of pro certo
without, however, altering captus to coptum. Such an incongruity is
called anacoluthon (change of grammatical construction).

8. nuptiis: dative of purpose (5 30).

ιο. infestus is in S. always used in an active sense, i. e. hostile.
The statement is oi course purely rhetorical.

11. vigiliis . . . quietibus: i. e. his guilty conscience troubled him
by day andwould not allow him to sleep at night-conscientia: one
of the rare examples of the use of this word in its modern sense of con-
science. Cp. note ch. 14, 11.
