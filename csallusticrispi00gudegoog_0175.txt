NOTES 121

term lor a division (discessio). the consul puttiug the question in tbe
words: qui hoc censetis, illuc transite(= pedibus ire), qui alia omnia
(sc. censetis) in hanc partem-Ti. Neronis: Sallust does not imply,as
is universally assumed, that Tiberius Nero spoke before Caesar, who as
praetor-elect had precedence on the list oi speakers. Nero doubtless had
oiiered the motion to postpone a decision as an amendment, and

ἵ Silanus subsequently promised that he would vote ior it (iturum sc.

dixerat), but the substitute was probably, like Caesar’s, voted down and
then the vote was taken on the original motion oi Silanus and owing to
Cato's speech passed. The story told in later writers, that Silanus tried
to explain away his advocacy oi the death penalty by asserting that by
supplicium he meant lile imprisonment or exile, this being the worst
penalty that could legally beiall a Roman citizen, must be unhistorical,
ior his first speech could have leit no doubt as to his real meaning and
did not, as appears esp. irom ch. 51, 56 il.

22. praesidiis additis: This does not refer to the guards which
Cicero had stationed about the senate chamber, but to military rein·
iorcements, lor, according to other writers, Nero wanted action deierred,

until Catiline had been defeated in battle, when a more careiul in·
vestigation could be set on ioot. Nero may have been in secret sym·
pathy with the conspirators, his motion ior delay being rnade in their

interest. The latter part oi his resolution seems to belong to a
later version, put lorth by deienders oi the senate, upon whom Cicero
had subsequently thrown the responsibility oi the technically illegal exe·
cution.

23. censuerat: Sallust's iondness ior using the indicative in indi·
ect discourse makes it difficult to decide whether this quod clause merely
states the contents ol the sententio, or whether it is regarded as the ’
reason given by Silanus ior his sudden change. The former seems the
more probable alternative.

25. huiusce modi: on this introductory formula, see note cb.

20, 5·

(2.) Ch. li: T ke speech of Caesar.

There is but little, so laras the contents oi this speech are con·
cemed, which Caesar might not have uttered on this occasion, his final
resolution being also substantially identical with that attributed to him
by Cicero and others. The style and rhetorical features, however, show
it to be wholly the composition oi Sallust, a solitary parallelism oia
usage noticeably frequent in Caesar (see note to l. 127) being unques·
tionably accidental.
