NOTES ¹¹3

ut. . . opus erit). With one other exception, the governing verb in
Sallust always precedes the purpose clause.

7. homines militares: being men ol military experience they went
about their task in a quiet, business-like lashion. This phrase is the
nearest equivalent in Latin lor the word ‘officers,' as opposed to the
common soldier (gregarius miles).

9. ad id toci: the partitive genitive depending upon a neuter pro-
noun (5 24) govemed by a preposition seems to be colloquial usage and
is in prose first met with in Sallust.

10. utrimque: at each end ol the bridge.

11. cito, etc: this. as wellas Cicero's account, implies that the
Allobroges themselves had not previously been apprised ol the contem-
plated stratagem, but they quiclrly recognized its purport.

14. multa: earnestly. Latin is more concrete than English.

16. vitae: dative or possibly genit, lor Sallust is the first to extend

the use ol the genitive with adject. to any considerable degree-sese
dedit lrom se dedere, to surrender.

XLVI

(5.) Ch. xlvi-xlvii: The arrested conspirators, confronted with the
evidence of their guilt, confessed at a special meeting of the Senate
(Dec. 3l4, 361³. e.). Cicero’s doubts as to the proper mode os dealing
with them.

a. eura . . . laetitia: the explanation ol these conflictiug emotions
follows in chiastic order (laetabatur . . . anxius erat).

4. periculiS, abl. oi separation (5 30).

5. civibus deprehensis: temporal ablat. absol.

⁶. lacto opus esset: what he ought to do. subjunct. ol lndirect

question alter dubitans (ἓ 76).
7. sibi . . . oneri . . . reipublicae: Best taken as a dative oi

the person and the thing with sore (ἓ 16), followed by the gerundival
genit. ol quality. (Cp. ch. ὁ, 23.) Il Sallust had intended rei publicae to
be construed as a dative ol purpose in contrast with sibi, he would prob-
ably have placed oneri in the second clause-Cicero could not have
loreseen that the trouble caused by his conduct would eventually lead to
his banishment.

9. confirmato animo: Later writers supply us with the information
that Cicero was urged to take the course he did by an omen which
occurred at a religious ceremony, the deliberations ol the consul being,
however, assigned to a different time than the one here given. Sallust
omitted all these details either because he discredited their authenticity
