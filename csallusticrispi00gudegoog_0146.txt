92 NOTES

here distributed over two sentences. They serve to give a vivid pic-
tureos the existing excitement.

5. cuiquam as an adject. ior ulli with a non-personal noun (laco)
is rare, but as homini intervenes, the same attributive was made to do
duty ior both. ⁸

7. rei publicae: far the cammonwealtb, objective genitive with
timor, made especially emphatic by its position.

8. magnitudine: causal ablat-This noun must not be taken as is
universally done, with rei publicae, but with belli, lor otherwise insolitus
would be unwarranted. Moreover, the greatness ol a state, so iar lrom
arousing any apprehension (timor) regarding the outcome ol a war,
would, on the contrary, have engendered a strong feeling oi security.

ιι. diffidere always takes the dative ol the person, and so here, ior
patriae is personified.

12. eadem illa: i. e. Catiline, regardless oi the suffering he would
cause, obstinately persisted in his course. ⁸

13. lege Plautia sc. de vi. This law was passed by M. Plautius
Silvanus, when tribune oi the people, about 89 Β. c. It was directed
against violence and breach ol the public peace. The trial owing
to Catiline’s departure never came ofl. He had, however, once before
(64 u. e.) been indicted under the same law by Lucceius, the historian

15. expurgandi: also governed by causa-sicuti iurgio: this
reading ol the manuscripts is unintelligible, lor iurgia is practically a
technical term designating an altercation, a wordy quarrel or tilt be-
tween twa parties, either in the senate or the law court, and is opposed
to a set speech prepared beforehand, hence it must refer to something
which had not yet taken place, but which Catiline by his presence
might provoke. We expect si quo, si alone orsi forte. The subjunct.
is due to indir. discourse, the apodosis being implied in the gerunds
Oratio recta : dissimulabo aut me expurgabo si qua iurgia lacessitus era.

17. sive. . . sive: Cicero’s speech leaves no doubt that hc was
affected by both emotions.

18. luculentam, like its Engl. equivalent, brilliant, splendid, in-
cludes both the style and contents. This epithet, as well as the follow·
ing comment, is again incompatible with the assumption that Sallust
was especially biased against Cicero. See Introd. p. xii.

19. postea scriptam edidit: Cicero tells us himself, that he pub-
lished (in 60 13. e.) all the speeches delivered by him during his consul-
ship. The ancient orators as a rule published their speeches, but they
first subjected them to a carelul revision, changing, ampliiying or con-
