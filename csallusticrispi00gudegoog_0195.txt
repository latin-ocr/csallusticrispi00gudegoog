(1.) ch. lvi-lvii: Catiline attempts with two legions to escape into Trans-
alpine Gaul, but is surrounded and forced ta give battle.

dues legiones: this was the regular iorce allotted to a consul,
Catiline posing as such, as appears lrom ch. 36, a fl. A lull legion at
this time had seldom more than 3‚6oo men, there being ten cohorts to a
legion. By pressing into service armed and unarmed alike, Catiline had
succceded in bringing up his lorces at least to the normal numerical
strength ol two legions, when the news oi the execution oi his lellow
conspirators reached him, tidings which caused a great number to desert
his cause. It is, therefore, impossible to determine how many men he

4. ex sociis: i. e. who had joined him from Rome.

6. spatio. . . numero: ablat. oi time and means respectively

the alii clauses being in apposition with ceteri and most probably Sal·
lust wrote thus, alii (abbreviated at) easily dropping out beiore at ol
armaverat.

10. sparos: this was a weapon shaped like a shepherd's crook,
with a steel blade or bayonet fastened at the end-lanceas: orig-
inally a Spanish or Gallie weapon hung with a leather thong. The
lance was longer than the sparus.

12. lacere. .. movere . . . dare: histor. infinit.

15. habitururn (sc. esse) . . . patravisseot = habebo εἰ . . . pa-
traverint (lut. peri.) in direct discourse.

16. euius = quorum, a remarkable ² construction according to sense,'
the slaves being regarded as a class, This aristocratic attitude toward
eolisting slaves was not shared by Lentulus. Cp. ch. 44, 16.

17. opibus: ablat. ol means with fretus (ξ 33).
