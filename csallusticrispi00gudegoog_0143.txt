3. longius = diutius: this temporal meaning is not elsewhere
found in Sallust, but frequently in other writers, such as Caesar.

4. quo consilio: abl. ol quality (ᾗ 38).-ioret: indir. question,
with compertum habebat (ξ 76).

5. rem ad senatum refert: the technical term lor bringing a
matter officially before the senate, ‘to oller a resolution! This body is
repeatedly represented by Sallust as lacking in energy and loresight.
Cp. ch. 16, 17.

⁶. plerumque: often. See note ch. 3, 1³·

7. solet sc. fieri, which is always omitted by Sallust with this phrase
(so ch. 30, 5), lor ch. 22, 6, fleri consuevit is only an apparent exception.
-darentt the absence ol ut may be explained on the ground that
this is real jussive subjunctive, the imperfect being due to oratio·
obliqua, but verbs ol deciding, etc, frequently take the simple sub·
junct, which represents aparatactic stage ol the language, antedating
the development ol the subordinate ut clause (5 50).

8. caperet: subj. in substantive clause developed from the Volitive
(ἓ bril—detrimenti: partitive genit. (5 24).-This celebrated decree,
by which the supreme authority was delegated to the consul or some
other magistrate in times ol great danger, seems not to antedate the
end ol the third Punic War (146 Β. e.), a dictator being chosen belore

martial law, the state ol siege or the reading ol the riot act, except
that in the Roman analogue the authority remained vested in a civil
officer who could, however, in this instance also exercise the military
‘imperium.'-ea potestas . . . maxima: Tr. this power is the
greatest conserrcd by, etc. . . . authoriaing him, etc.

8. more Romano is not strictly accurate, lor not only, as just
pointed out, was this emergency measure ol comparatively recent origin,
but it was seldom passed without strong protest on the part ol the pop-
ular party, who regarded it as an unconstitutional procedure.

ιο. exercitum . . . habere: note the double chiasmuS, exactly as
inch.27,6(a:b:ab::ba::a:b).

13. aliter, etc: it may be observed, on the strength ol this passage,
that Sallust, ii he was consistent, cannot have approved ol the banish·
ment ol Cicero, which was based upon the charge that he had put Roman
citizens to death withouta regular trial, lor il this decree could authorize
the consul coercere, etc, Cicero had acted within strictly constitutional ’
limits, the appeal to the people ( provocatio) as well as the public trial
being suspended, while the decree was in lorce.

14. consuli lor consulibus is here used, either because Cicero‘s col·
