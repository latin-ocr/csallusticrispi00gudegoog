19. tenebatur ior the compound detinebatur-ac me: and so l.
To bring out the emphasis involved in placing the pronoun at the begin-
ning, we must translate, as ii it read: ego honoris cupidine vexabar ·
eedem famei quei ceteri vexabantur.-cum ‘while,’ with the subj. (ἓ 61).

20. honoris . . . vexabat: the thought is not quite accurately ex-
pressed, ior S. does not mean to say that political ambition as such eir-⁴
cites slander and envy, but that it does so only when a man has succeeded
in gratiiying his ambition by securing high positions, as he himself had
done. The author doubtless did not think it expedient in this apologetic
passage to remind the reader oi the offices which he held, ior their
administration may have justified in a measure the bad repnte here com-
plained oi. See Introd. p. x.

21. lama is used ina good or bad sense, according to the context,

calling as they do chiefly ior physical exertion, as iar inferior to intellect-
ual occupations See ch. 2, 26 fi.-—For the ablat. with intentum, the
subject accusat. oi agere, cp. note ch. 2, 27.

⁶. a quo incepto: the precedence oi the relative clause is a Latin
idiom, once also prevalent in English. Transi. as ii it read eidem (= ad
id inceptum studiumque) regressus, a quibus me . . . detinuerat.

8. carptim, irom carpere, to select See introd. p. xxii-quaeque
= quaecumque-memoria : ablat. with dignus (ἓ 33).

ιο. spe, etc: neither the hope oi further political advancement, nor
the fear oi offending those in power, nor strong party-feeling could now
warp his judgment or cause him knowingly to distort historical iactS.
On the statement, see Introd. p. xvi.

12. paucis sc. verbis. If brevity had been Sallust’s real intention,
