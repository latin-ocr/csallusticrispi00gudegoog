NOTES 93

never delivered, was subsequently reduced to writing, the fiction of
actual delivery being maintained throughout. Examples of this practice
are Cicero's pro Milone, the famous Second Philippic and the speeches
against Verres. In the case of the widely circulated speeches of so
great an orator as Cicero, Sallust naturally did not feel called upon to
give even a bare outline, nor would he venture to adopt the only other
alternative ol reproducing their contents in his own language. See
note ch. ao, 5.

20. demisso vultu, voce supplici: ablat. of manner, the perfect
pass, partic. and the attributive noun taking the place of adject. mod·
itiers, hence the omission of cum (ξ 35). Note the chiasmus, the an-
tithesis being further emphasized by alliteration.

22, temere: blindly, recklessly, from a root meaning dart-crede-
rent: subjunct. in subst. clause developed from the Volitive (ἓ 64).-
εἰ = tali, so often. Ablat. of source (ἓ 31).-ortum sc. esse depends
upon a verb of saying implied in postulavere. Cp. note ch. 21, 9; aa,
7. The accusat. seis, as frequently, reserved for the second clause.

24. haberet: subjunct. of result (ἓ aot-ne existumarent: sub-
junct. in substantive clause developed from the Volitive, the tense
being due to indirect discourse. In oratio recta it would be: nolite ex-v
istumare or ne existumetis (ᾗ 64).—sibi : dative ol person with opus esse.

25. plebem here loosely used for populum, for neither did Catiline’s
ancestors side with the common people nor would he have defended
himself on such a plea before an aristocratic senate. Cp. note ch. 37, o.

26. essent: subjunct. of indirect discourse (ᾖ ool-perdita re
publica: ablat. of means with opus est (ξ 33).

27. cum . . . servaret: subjunct. of circumstance or situation,
the tense being due to the indirect discourse (ξ orl-inquilinus: this
word, which is not elsewhere used asan adjective, originally designated
one who lived in a house not his own, hence applied in a political sense
to one who was not a Roman citizen. It is true that Arpinum, Cicero's
birthplace, had been received into the Roman commonwealth as early
as 188 s. c., but to the scion of so ancient a Roman family as that of
the gens Sergia, Cicer0, the homo novus, may well have seemed a for-
eigner, and this very epithet (peregrinus) is applied to him at a subse-
quent time by one of his opponents.

28. cum . . . adderet: observe the force of the imperfect.-
obstrepere . . . vocare: historical infinit.

31. quoniam, etc.: according to Cicero this reply was made to
Cato before the consular elections, when the latter threatened Catiline
with an accusation for bribery, but the same or a similar answer if at,
all historical, may have been also made on this occasion.
