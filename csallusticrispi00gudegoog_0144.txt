XXX

(11.) Ch. xxx: Speafic measures taken to crush tlte conspiracy.

1. post paucos dies: the decree was passed Oct. 21 and Manlius’s
uprising took place Oct. 27 (see below, l. 4), a date confirmed in Cicero’s
lirst Catilinian speech. “ Don't you remember that 1 announced on Oct.
21 in the senate, that C. Manlius. . .w0uld take up arms . . . on

'Oct 27i''—in senatu, etc. : a Roman senator was not compelled to
speak strictly to the question, but could bring up any matter which he
deemed important.

2. Faesulis: from F. (ἓ 41).-adlatas sc. esse.

3. scriptum erat: in the case ol compound tenses ol transitive verbs

him in some suburban temple to pass upon his claim.

12. paucorum: a few, not necessarily the few, in the sense oi the
nobility‚ the reference being rather to some ol the corrupt henchmen ol
Pompey who claimed that, as he had been appointed commender-in-

chiei in 66 Β. e., the victories ol others were technically won by his sub-
* ordinatos, who were in consequence not entitled to an individual triumph.
The nobles at this time were not lavorably disposed toward Pompey,
