138 Nonus

for Sallust cannot have had the intention of blackening the character oi
Caesar to enhance that of Cato by contrast. The analysis of the two
men possesses a genuine value, when taken independently of each other,
for they present in reality no commensurable standard of comparison.

LIV

1. Igitur, well, then, is frequently so used as a particle of tran·
sition-genus: Caesar traced back his lineage to Iulus, the son of
Aeneas, while the gens Porcia was of plebeian origin, but Cato the
Elder, the great-grandfather of the subject of this comparison, though
the first one of the Porcii to distinguish himself, had invested the family
name with so imperishable a lustre as to make it the equal of any other.
—aetasz Caesar was Cato's senior by five or seven years, according as
we place his birth at 102 or 1oo n. e.-eloquentia: according to the
unanimous verdict of antiquity, Caesar, the orator, was second only to
Cicero. The latter highly praises Cato's eloquence, but he does soin
reference to the fact that the Stolos, as a rule, paid but little attention
to the artistic handling oi the spoken or written word. In any case, he
was incomparably inferior to Caesar.

3. alia (sc. gloria) alii: but of a different kind in each. We should
expect the dative altera alteri, there being only two, but the other collo·
canon, as an expression of reciprocal relation, had become too firmly
fixed to be changed, and in fact alter is never so used-beneficiis,
etc: this in his earlier days caused him to become heavily involved in
debt. See note ch. 49, 11 f. Observe the chiasmus.

4. mansuetudine, etc. On the repeated collocation of these terms,
see note ch. 52, 34.

⁶. dando: i. e. bribes, for his liberality had already been referred
to.-sublevando: with special reference to politics, in exerting his in-
fluence to secure offices for his panizaris—ignoscundo: by pardoning
his political opponents, such as Marcellus, Ligarius and Cicero, for ex·
ample. The latter says of Caesar that he never forgot anything-save
an injury done to himself i

7. nihil largiundo: opposed to dando. Cato is said, however, to
have connived at bribery, but on the ground of public expediency, to
secure the election of Bibulus as Caesar's colleague in the consulship.

8. miseris perfugium: this was particularly true during the Civil
War.-maiis pernicies, as in his attitude toward the conspirators.

9. facilitas: Caesar was always accessible and adame—constan·
tia: Cato’s uncompromising adherence to what he thought right was,
however, often akin to obstinacy, and devoid of the insight and pru.
