144 NOTES

22. vincimus: note the eliect oi the present ior the future, the
prospective victory being regarded as an abiding condition.

23. conmeatus sc. erunt. On the combination oi esse withan
adverb (abunde), see ch. 21, 2.

26. texerint, luture perfect, quem being equivalent to si eum.-
nobis et illis: datives with impendet (ἓ 16) ; et, ior the less idiomatic
quam, alter eadem.

27. pro. . . pto . . . pro: observe the emphatic anaphora. The
sentiment itseli occurs regularly in speeches oi this kind.

28. supervacaneum, etc, a very condensed expression ior illis s.
pugnare, cum tantum pro paucorum potentia, non pro se ipsi pugnent.-
Note the alliteration.

29. paucorum here again used in its political sense, the aristoc-
racy.

33. alienes opes expectere: i. e. alter losing all they had, they
might have eked out a miserable existence as clients oi some rich patron
or by receiving brisce-illa: those conditions, referring to what is now
past mattharios-haec: the present mterprisc with its splendid chauces
ol success. That the conspirators’ object, ii triumphant, wasto replenish
their empty purses hythe spoliation ol alienas opes, is apparently not
considered foeda viris in Catiline’s eyes.

35. haec: i. e. the critical position in which we lind ourselves.

36. pace, for peace. This is the more regular construction with
verbs ol erchange, the thing received being put into the ablative oi
price &coh-mutavit: has ever exchanged‚ gnomic perfect-nam, as
usually, implies an ellipsis, ‘In spite ol overwhelming numbers, we
must fight to the bitter end, ior, etc!

37. curn . . . everteris is merely a lengthier way oi saying in
suga. With the sentiment, cp. Virgil's lamous line: Una salus victis
nullam sperare salutem.

40. habetur, takes the place of,· is equivalent to.

42. me is made very emphatic by position-animus, aetas: cp.
Catiline‘s speech in ch. 20, 34, viget aetas, animus valet.

45. ne . . . queat: ne with prohibere is less common than the in-
finitive.

46. si . . . inviderit, a euphemismlorri victieritise-cavete . . .
amittatis neu . . . trucidemini. . . relinquatis. cavere with-
out ne or ut, with subjunctive is a mere circumlocution ior the imper-
ative. The following subjunctives are jussive.

48. virorum inore pugnantes is in chiastic arrangement with
capti . . . sicuti pecora, the comparison being intentionally varied
(sicuti . . . more).
