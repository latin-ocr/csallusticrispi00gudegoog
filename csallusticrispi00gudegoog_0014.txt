vi PREFACE

made without any guidance‚ but frequently meanings are
recorded which do not occur in the particular work to be
read, they being usually added either for the sake of com-
pleteness or for some etymological and semasiological rea-
sons, Such considerations, however excellent in them·
selves, evidently overlook the only justifiable object of
the Special Vocabulary. Ι have, therefore, constructed
it in such a way that the meaning of every word or phrase
is given with its appropriate rendering in the order of its
occurrence in the text, and with the reference to the par-
ticular chapter. This plan will enable a conscientious pu-
pil to prepare an adequate translation, and it at the same
time does away with the alleged necessity or expediency
of furnishing numerous translations in the Commentary‚
for these not only sorely tempt the pupil to dispense with
the Vocabulary, but they are, as he is apt to discover at
his peril, no sooner learned than forgotten.

The deviations from the basic text of Jordan are shn-
ply enumerated on page 149 of NoteS, a detailed justifica-
tion of my readings being out of place inan edition of this
nature. As regards the spelling, I have, for reasons which
can also not be given here, written the unassimilated
forms, except in the case of pp, ff, and mp. U for i, as in
ntoxumus, etc, volgus for vulgus, etc, have of course
been retained, but Ι have avoided, on purely practical
grounds, such forms as novos for novus.

In the Introduction and Notes I have throughout been
at special pains to be brief, without sacrificing clearness or
omitting comment necessary to a full appreciation of this
earliest specimen of Roman historiography or essential to

a pupil at that stage of Latin study at which the Catilina
of Sallust is generally read.
